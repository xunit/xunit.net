<h2>Visual Studio Runner 2.0.1</h2>

<p><em>
  For information on using xUnit.net from within Visual Studio, see
  <a href="/docs/running-tests-in-vs.html">Running xUnit.net tests in Visual
  Studio</a>.
</em></p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>BUG:</strong> Fixed an issue when running xUnit.net 1.9.2 tests where
    where theories would sometimes not correctly show all results, despite being
    run. Test totals, test results, and test icon indicators in Test Explorer
    should now all be working as expected.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>BUG:</strong> Test discovery failures were being reported with error
    messages, which caused Team Build to report projects with mixed .NET and
    C/C++ projects to be "Partially Successful", even though all appropriate
    unit tests passed.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>BUG:</strong> Fixed an issue where tests will very long names (longer
    than ~ 450 characters) would cause discovery errors, due to limitations on the
    SQL Server tables used by the Test Explorer.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>BUG:</strong> Diagnostic message output was missing the xUnit.net
    banner and execution time.
  </li>
</ul>
