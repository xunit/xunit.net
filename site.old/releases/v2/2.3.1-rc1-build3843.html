<h2>xUnit.net v2 2.3.1 RC 1</h2>

<h3>Core framework</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    Removed external dependencies. This primarily caused issues with developers who wanted to use a newer
    version of JSON.NET than we were linked against (9.0.1), but also affected uses of
    <code>Microsoft.DotNet.InternalAbstractions</code> and
    <code>Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyModel</code>.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>dotnet xunit runner</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Optimized assembly resolution lookup performance.</li>
  <li>
    <strong>BUG:</strong> Assembly resolution sometimes failed on case-sensitive file systems (this
    primarily affected Linux users, as Windows and OS X by default use case-preserving but
    case-insensitive file systems).
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>BUG:</strong> Unmanaged library lookup would sometimes fail because of names which didn't
    match the filename (for example, asking for 'foo' but the library is really 'libfoo'). This primarily
    affected Linux and OS X users where dynamic libraries tend to have prefixes like 'lib'.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Console runner</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>BUG:</strong> Fixed an issue where the XML results file was being over-written without
    erasing the old contents, the end result of which could be corrupted XML files.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>MSBuild runner</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>BUG:</strong> Fixed an issue where MSBuild runner reporters were not working. This was
    most obviously affecting TeamCity and AppVeyor users who lost their test reporting.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>BUG:</strong> The XML results output file was being left open longer than intended. Now
    it should be closed by the time the <code>&lt;xunit&gt;</code> task has completed.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Visual Studio runner</h3>
<p><em>
  For information on using xUnit.net from within Visual Studio, see
  <a href="/docs/getting-started-desktop.html#run-tests-visualstudio">Running
  tests with Visual Studio</a> in the Getting Started documentation.
</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>BUG:</strong> Fixed issues with the performance-optimized serialization that were
    causing <code>[Fact]</code> tests to be broken with Live Unit Testing.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>BUG:</strong> Fixed an issue where test classes with mixed facts and theories
    and class/collection fixtures ended up with two fixtures being created (one for the
    facts and one for the theories).
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>BUG:</strong> Fixed an issue where sometimes source file mappings were broken,
    especially with projects whose name started with 'n'. (Yes, really.)
  </li>
</ul>
