Today, we're shipping one new release:

* **xUnit.net Core Framework v2 `2.9.2`**

It's been 4 days since the release of [`2.9.1`](2.9.1).

As always, we'd like to thank all the users who contributed to the success of xUnit.net through usage, feedback, and code contributions. ðŸŽ‰

## Release Notes

These release notes are a comprehensive list of changes from `2.9.1` to `2.9.2`.

### Core Framework

* **BUG:** An update to `TheoryData<T>` in 2.9.1 broke usages where developers were using arrays (i.e., `TheoryData<SomeType[]>`) where the array data type is a reference type (i.e., `TheoryData<string[]>` failed, but `TheoryData<int[]>` did not).
