Today, we're shipping three new releases:

* **xUnit.net Core Framework v2 2.8.1**
* xUnit.net Analyzers 1.14.0 ([release notes](/releases/analyzers/1.14.0))
* xUnit.net Visual Studio adapter 2.8.1 ([release notes](/releases/visualstudio/2.8.1))

It's been 1 month since the release of [2.8.0 RTM](2.8.0).

As always, we'd like to thank all the users who contributed to the success of xUnit.net through usage, feedback, and code contributions. ðŸŽ‰

## Release Notes

These release notes are a comprehensive list of changes from 2.8.0 to 2.8.1.

### Core Framework

* We have updated the message provided when a fixture used in `IClassFixture<>` throws in its constructor. The new message more clearly illustrates what happened (`"Class fixture type 'TypeName' threw in its constructor"`). [xunit/xunit#2927](https://github.com/xunit/xunit/issues/2927){: .issue-link }

* **BUG:** We fixed an issue when custom attributes derived from `FactAttribute` threw in one of their properties (like `Skip`), the error was not being properly surfaced.

### Assertion Library

* We have updated `Assert.Matches` and `Assert.DoesNotMatch` so that the regular expression value will be correctly syntax colored by Visual Studio.

### Runners

* We have added the ability to show output from `ITestOutputHelper` immediately while a test is running rather than waiting for the test to complete. (Note: This can add significant noise to the output while running tests, so we recommend you only temporarily enable this when attempting to track down an issue with a misbehaving test that never finishes/takes a long time to finish.)

  * We have added a [`showLiveOutput`](/docs/configuration-files#showLiveOutput) configuration item
  * We have added a [`ShowLiveOutput`](/docs/runsettings#ShowLiveOutput) RunSettings item
  * The console runner has added a `-showliveoutput` switch
  * The MSBuild runner has added a `ShowLiveOutput="true"` property

  Note that `dotnet test` usually hides all output from xUnit.net unless you add the `--logger "console;verbosity=normal"` switch. To see output when running tests in Visual Studio Test Explorer, check the Output window's "Tests" tab. Screenshots are shown in the linked issue. [xunit/visualstudio.xunit#408](https://github.com/xunit/visualstudio.xunit/issues/408){: .issue-link }

### Runner Utility

* We have obsoleted the two overloads of `AssemblyRunner.Start()` and replaced it with one which takes a start options structure (`Xunit.Runners.AssemblyRunnerStartOptions`). The number of parameters had grown unwieldy, and adding new ones when all parameters were optional was causing overload resolution problems. The obsoleted overloads will be removed in v3.
