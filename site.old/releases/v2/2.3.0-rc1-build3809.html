<h2>xUnit.net v2 2.3 RC 1</h2>

<h3>Core framework</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    The need to have referenced DLL files copied during build has been removed.
    This should significantly increase build performance, as well as reduce disk
    space usage.
  </li>
  <li>Updated <code>TheoryData</code> to support up to 10 data parameters.</li>
  <li>Ongoing performance work.</li>
</ul>

<h3>dotnet xunit runner</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Added a new <code>-stoponfail</code> switch to stop running tests after the first test failure.</li>
  <li>
    Added a new <code>-msbuildverbosity</code> switch to allow the user to choose which verbosity
    level to use when invoking <code>msbuild.exe</code> or <code>dotnet msbuild</code>. This value
    defaults to <code>minimal</code>, which was previously the hardcoded value.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>BUG:</strong> Fixed several issues related to .NET Core 1.1 and 2.0. The runner will now
    dynamically detect the exact version of the framework that the tests were linked against (for
    example, <code>1.0.4</code>) and run with that framework. The user can still override this default
    choice by passing the <code>-fxversion</code> switch.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Console runner</h3>
<ul>
  <li>The console runner will now ensure the directory for results files (XML, HTML, etc.) exists.</li>
  <li>Added a new <code>-stoponfail</code> switch to stop running tests after the first test failure.</li>
  <li>
    <strong>[.NET Core]</strong> The console runner no longer requires you to pass the <code>.deps.json</code>
    file to <code>dotnet exec</code>, as this file is discovered automatically now. As a result, you can
    invoke the console runner with multiple tests assemblies, as follows:

    <blockquote class="padded"><code>dotnet /path/to/xunit.console.dll /path/to/tests1.dll /path/to/tests2.dll</code></blockquote>

    You will commonly find <code>xunit.console.dll</code> in the NuGet package cache (for example,
    <code>C:\Users\MyUsername\.NuGet\packages</code>), or if you're inside a project that takes a
    package reference to <code>xunit.runner.console</code>, you can use the MSBuild property
    <code>$(XunitConsoleNetCoreAppPath)</code> (for .NET Core 1.x) or
    <code>$(XunitConsoleNetCore2AppPath)</code> (for .NET Core 2.x). For an example, please see the
    <a href="https://github.com/xunit/xunit.integration/blob/503b15462d08dfd13a416a60a9086b6a51428393/console/v2x_netcoreapp10/v2x_netcoreapp10.csproj#L12-L14">console
    runner integration test project</a>.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>MSBuild runner</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Added a new <code>StopOnFail</code> attribute to stop running tests after the first test failure.</li>
  <li>
    The .NET Core MSBuild runner has been removed. Users who wish to run .NET Core tests
    from within an MSBuild project should considering using the <code>&lt;Exec&gt;</code>
    task to run <code>dotnet xunit</code> or <code>dotnet test</code>, or to add targets
    to your <code>.csproj</code> files that can directly invoke the console runner.
    For an example, please see the
    <a href="https://github.com/xunit/xunit.integration/blob/503b15462d08dfd13a416a60a9086b6a51428393/console/v2x_netcoreapp10/v2x_netcoreapp10.csproj#L12-L14">console
    runner integration test project</a>.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Runner Utility</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    A new <code>NetCoreAssemblyDependencyResolver</code> class was added which can be
    used by runner authors to provide support for loading dependencies of test assemblies
    by reading the <code>.deps.json</code> file that's generated, and resolving those
    dependencies from the user's local NuGet cache. To use it, call its constructor
    with the full path to the test assembly on disk, just before creating the controller
    (for example, <code>XunitFrontController</code>). The object is disposable, so placing
    it inside a <code>using</code> block is strongly advised. For an example, please see
    <a href="https://github.com/xunit/xunit/blob/2c85a423aa7b3aff3ddfe45fb689dfb7585169f3/src/xunit.console/ConsoleRunner.cs#L358-L362">ConsoleRunner.cs</a>
    in the console runner.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Extensibility</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Added <code>sbyte</code> and <code>Nullable&lt;sbyte&gt;</code> as serializable types.</li>
  <li>
    <code>MemberDataAttributeBase</code> can support data that is expressed as the non-generic
    <code>IEnumerable</code>, in addition to the generic <code>IEnumerable&lt;T&gt;</code>.
  </li>
  <li>
    Added the <code>xunit.console</code> NuGet package. Unlike the runner package (<code>xunit.runner.console</code>),
    this contains the .NET Core console runner as a linkable library, to be consume by developers who
    wish to write a simple console runner that wraps the existing console runner.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Visual Studio runner</h3>
<p><em>
  For information on using xUnit.net from within Visual Studio, see
  <a href="/docs/getting-started-desktop.html#run-tests-visualstudio">Running
  tests with Visual Studio</a> in the Getting Started documentation.
</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>
    The GUID that appeared on the end of the tooltip for test cases in the Visual Studio
    Test Explorer UI has been removed. The tooltip will now just show the fully qualified
    name of the test method (regardless of the display name of the test).
  </li>
  <li>Ongoing performance work.</li>
</ul>
