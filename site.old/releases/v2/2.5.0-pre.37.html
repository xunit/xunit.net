<h2>
  xUnit.net v2 2.5.0 Pre-Release (build 37)
</h2>

<p>
  This is co-released with
  <code>xunit.analyzers</code> version <a href="/releases/analyzers/1.2.0-pre.27"><code>1.2.0-pre.27</code></a> and
  <code>xunit.runner.visualstudio</code> version <a href="/releases/visualstudio/2.5.0-pre.22"><code>2.5.0-pre.22</code></a>.
</p>

<h3>Assertion library</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    Added <code>Assert.NotNull</code> and <code>Assert.Null</code> overloads explicitly for <code>Nullable&lt;T&gt;</code>
    struct values. Both include new messages, and the <code>NotNull</code> variant returns the unwrapped <code>T</code>
    value. This prevents boxing, and makes it trivial to use the non-null value. (We don't need this with the reference
    versions, since the type doesn't change, it just sheds its nullability, which we automatically do with
    the <code>[NotNull]</code> attribute.)

  </li>
  <li>
    Fixed an issue where using the assertion library as source, combined with <code>xunit.analyzers</code>, causes
    compilation to report <code>xUnit2007</code> and <code>xUnit2015</code> warnings. These warnings aren't applicable
    to the assertion library itself, so they've been suppressed with pragmas. This means you should no longer need to
    ignore or disable those warnings when using <code>xunit.assert.source</code> (or the Git submodule).

  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Runners</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>BUG:</strong> Fixed an issue with the console runner where sometimes, when using newer versions of Windows
    Terminal, the output of pointer characters (&#x2193; and &#x2191;) would be garbled as &#xFFFD;.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Extensibility</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    Fixed a performance issue with reporter discovery related to scanning every single DLL in your output folder looking
    for types which implement reporters. <strong><em>Now we only scan libraries named</em></strong> <code>*reporters*.dll</code>
    <strong><em>which may break any custom reporters you are using from first or third party assemblies without an appropriate
    name.</em></strong>
    <a class="issue-link" href="https://github.com/xunit/visualstudio.xunit/issues/317">xunit/visualstudio.xunit#317</a>
  </li>
  <li>
    This release makes <code>ArgumentFormatter</code> and <code>CollectionTracker</code> public (in the assertion library).
    The former is used to pretty print values in assertion failures as well arguments for display names of data-driven
    tests. The latter is a newly introduced class whose job is to prevent double enumeration while tracking the last few
    values visited, so that they can be printed when assertion failures happen without requiring a second enumeration.
  </li>
  <li>
    We added several pragmas to disable warnings that would occur when <code>XUNIT_NULLABLE</code> was not defined,
    but your project had <code>&lt;nullable&gt;enable&lt;/nullable&gt;</code>. You should always define <code>XUNIT_NULLABLE</code>
    when importing <code>xunit.assert.source</code> (or the Git submodule) when you have nullable enabled, but at least now
    if you forget to do that, there won't be any compiler warnings as a result of you using our non-nullable path. Note
    that we had to use pragmas to disable warnings rather than just using <code>#nullable disable</code> in the files,
    since that pragma didn't exist in C# prior to version 8 (and we set a minimum C# version of 6).
  </li>
</ul>
