<h2>Release Notes</h2>

<p>These release notes are a comprehensive list of changes from 2.7.0 to 2.7.1.</p>

<h3>Core Framework</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    We have added support for .NET diagnostic events to be reported for the start and finish of individual
    tests. The event source name is <code>xUnit.TestEventSource</code>, and the provider GUID is
    <code>ae399e80-45fc-4219-aacc-b73a458ad7e1</code>. Please note that if you are trying to use
    <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/profiling/concurrency-visualizer">Concurrency Visualizer</a>
    that sometimes the start &amp; stop events will not be correctly correlated for async tests, as they may
    begin and end on different threads. This is unfortunately a limitation of Concurrency Visualizer, though
    the events should always be present (but not correlated, so marked as diamonds). Please see the linked
    issue for extensive discussion on this.

  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>BUG:</strong> We fixed an issue with the timeout async guard (that is, the code that ensures
    that you must write an async test to use <code>Timeout</code> on <code>[Fact]</code> or
    <code>[Theory]</code>) which was inappropriately triggering for F# projects using the <code>task</code>
    keyword to define the async body of the test.

  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>BUG:</strong> We fixed an edge case <code>SystemAccessViolation</code> that could occur as we
    were inspecting thrown exceptions, and their properties (like <code>StackTrace</code> or <code>Message</code>)
    were in turn throwing. While this violates the contract of the <code>Exception</code> class, the edge case was
    seemingly caused by something that was corrupting the exception. Catching and ignoring these exceptions will
    at least all affected projects to continue to run, albeit with missing information in the exceptions.

  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Runner Utility</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>BUG:</strong> We fixed an unintentional binary backward compatibility breaking bug with
    <code>ConfigReader</code> where we added an optional parameter to the <code>Load</code> functions.
    The old signature has been restored but marked as obsolete and hidden from Intellisense.
    <a class="issue-link" href="https://github.com/xunit/xunit/issues/2896">xunit/xunit#2896</a>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Assertion Library</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    We have updated <code>Assert.Equal</code> overloads for <code>Memory&lt;char&gt;</code>,
    <code>ReadOnlyMemory&lt;char&gt;</code>, <code>Span&lt;char&gt;</code>, and
    <code>ReadOnlySpan&lt;char&gt;</code> to more clearly indicate that the values are treated
    as strings and not individual characters. This is primarily a documentation issue in the
    API documentation (via XML doc comments), as they have always been treated this way.
  </li>
  <li>
    We have added an additional overload for <code>Assert.Raises</code> which accepts <code>Action</code>
    for attach and detach arguments, in addition to the existing <code>Action&lt;EventHandler&gt;</code> and
    <code>Action&lt;EventHandler&lt;T&gt;&gt;</code> signatures.
    <a class="issue-link" href="https://github.com/xunit/xunit/issues/2888">xunit/xunit#2888</a>
  </li>
  <li>
    We have added additional overloads for <code>Assert.Raises</code>, <code>Assert.RaisesAny</code>,
    <code>Assert.RaisesAnyAsync</code>, and <code>Assert.RaisesAsync</code> which accepts
    <code>Action&lt;Action&gt;</code> and <code>Action&lt;Action&lt;T&gt;&gt;</code> for attach and detach
    arguments, to support event handlers which are defined as <code>Action</code> or <code>Action&lt;T&gt;</code>
    rather than <code>EventHandler</code> or <code>EventHandler&lt;T&gt;</code>.

  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>BUG:</strong> We fixed an issue for users of the <code>xunit.assert.source</code> NuGet package
    that caused compilation errors when also referencing <code>xunit.core</code> from duplicate code.
    <a class="issue-link" href="https://github.com/xunit/xunit/issues/2889">xunit/xunit#2889</a>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>BUG:</strong> We fixed an issue with <code>Assert.Equivalent</code> not correctly comparing
    <code>decimal</code> values. It was always reporting two decimals values as equivalent regardless of
    their actual value.
