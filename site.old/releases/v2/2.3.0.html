<h1>Release Notes: October 6, 2017</h1>

<h2>Hello, v2 2.3!</h2>

<p>
  Today, we're shipping xUnit.net 2.3; this includes RTM builds of the core framework
  and the Visual Studio runner. Ah, the sweet feeling of blue lights:
</p>

<p><img class="border" src="/images/releases/2.3.png" width="448" /></p>

<p>
  It's been nearly 8 months since the release of <a href="2.2.0">2.2 RTM</a>. That was
  strongly aligned with .NET Core 1.0, and in the intervening time, that team has now
  shipped a substantial 2.0 update. Similarly, xUnit.net 2.3 feels like it has a much
  improved experience for .NET Core users (both 1.x and 2.x).
</p>

<p>
  One of the core reasons we've done xUnit.net has been to improve the day-to-day
  unit testing experience for .NET developers. At a previous job, we had discussions
  about adding Roslyn code analyzers to xUnit.net as a way to make our guidance
  more concrete. These rules and fixes would represent our knowledge with issues
  commonly faced by unit testers in general, and xUnit.net users in particular.
  <a href="https://github.com/marcind">Marcin Dobosz</a>, one of our co-workers at
  the time, has stepped up and has done a tremendous job with the
  <a href="https://github.com/xunit/xunit.analyzers">xUnit.net Analyzers</a> project.
  Although this hasn't yet reached 1.0 status, we've already started including them
  when you reference the <code>xunit</code> meta-package; as a result, you will see
  our guidance light up as warnings and errors in your code.
</p>

<p>
  Visual Studio 2017 has seen some substantial improvements since its release 7
  months ago, with some great things on the horizon with 15.4 and 15.5. We are
  currently working on updated templates for the next release of the .NET SDK
  and a future update to Visual Studio 2017 which will include 2.3 references.
</p>

<p>
  As always, we'd like to thank all the users who contributed to the success
  of xUnit.net through usage, feedback, and code contributions. We had too many
  contributors this time around to thank individually, so know that every bug
  reported, every line of code PR'd, every conversation contributed to on Slack,
  were all appreciated!
</p>

<h2>What's New</h2>

<h3>Core Framework</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    As mentioned above, the <code>xunit</code> meta-package now includes a reference
    to the <code>xunit.analyzers</code> package automatically. We feel most users
    will benefit from these helpful rules and fixes. If you decide you would
    like to opt out, please remove your reference to <code>xunit</code>, and instead
    add references to <code>xunit.core</code> and <code>xunit.assert</code>.
  </li>
  <li>
    A significant amount of work was put into general performance improvements.
    The largest performance gains will be experienced by users who are running
    tests in the desktop CLR with app domains enabled (the default behavior).
    Additionally, we have spent time optimizing performance in the Visual Studio
    Test Explorer experience.
  </li>
  <li>
    We added the ability to disable cross-collection parallelization for individual
    test collections, via the test collection definition (by setting
    <code>[CollectionDefinition(DisableParallelization = true)]</code>). Parallel-capable
    test collections will be run first (in parallel), followed by parallel-disabled
    test collections (run sequentially).
  </li>
  <li>
    There have been several improvements to the assertion library, as well as new
    command line options (and MSBuild properties) to the test runners. Make sure to
    check out Intellisense and the command line runner help to see what's new!
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>.NET Core</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    A new runner for .NET Core has been added: <code>dotnet xunit</code>. This gives
    a first class experience for running xUnit.net tests that mirrors the functionality
    available to desktop CLR users via <code>xunit.console.exe</code>. We have updated
    <a href="/docs/getting-started-dotnet-core">Getting Started with .NET Core</a>
    to show how to incorporate support for <code>dotnet xunit</code>.
  </li>
  <li>
    The .NET Core console runner is also available directly via the
    <code>xunit.runner.console</code> NuGet package, and can be run via
    <code>dotnet C:\Path\to\xunit.console.dll C:\Path\to\TestLibrary.dll</code>.
    There are additional properties via MSBuild that can be used to automatically
    locate the runner; see the
    <a href="https://github.com/xunit/xunit.integration/tree/main/console">xUnit.net Integration Project</a>
    for examples of how to use this directly from your <code>.csproj</code> files.
  </li>
  <li>
    This is the first version to fully support .NET Core 2.0, and the support for
    .NET Core 1.0 has been greatly improved. In particular, users who noticed that
    we were copying large numbers of dependent DLLs will be happy to note that we
    have found a way around that. Also, any users who were previously trying to
    use libraries with native components (for example, <code>System.Data.SqlClient</code>)
    from .NET Core should now be able to properly use these packages (this fix
    affects all versions of .NET Core).
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Breaking Changes</h2>

<p class="important">
  The <code>xunit.runner.console</code> NuGet package has been changed; notably, the path
  to the <code>net452</code> executables has moved from <code>tools\</code> to
  <code>tools\net452\</code>. You will need to update any paths which previously hard-coded
  this path.
</p>

<p class="important">
  The <code>xunit.runner.msbuild</code> NuGet package has been changed; notably, the names
  of the MSBuild runner DLLs now include the target platform. This means if you had a
  hard-coded path to <code>xunit.runner.msbuild.dll</code>, this will need to be replaced
  with <code>xunit.runner.msbuild.net452.dll</code>.
</p>

<h2>Important Notes</h2>

<p class="note">
  If you are using Visual Studio 2013, you must use NuGet 2.12 or
  later to use xUnit.net 2.3, because support for <code>netstandard</code> is
  required. You will not be able to use xUnit.net 2.3 with Visual Studio 2012
  (if Visual Studio 2012 support is important, please stick with xUnit.net 2.1,
  the last version that officially supported 2012).
</p>

<p class="note">
  As a reminder: If you're extending xUnit.net and want to publish your extension
  as a NuGet package, you should import <code>xunit.extensibility.core</code> and/or
  <code>xunit.extensibility.execution</code>, not <code>xunit</code> or
  <code>xunit.core</code>. If you do this wrong, you might have problems generating
  your NuGet package via <code>dotnet pack</code>.
