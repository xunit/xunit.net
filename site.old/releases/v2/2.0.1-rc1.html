<h1>Release Notes: July 4, 2015</h1>

<h2>Visual Studio Runner 2.0.1 RC 1</h2>

<p><em>
  For information on using xUnit.net from within Visual Studio, see
  <a href="/docs/running-tests-in-vs.html">Running xUnit.net tests in Visual
  Studio</a>.
</em></p>

<p class="note">
  The NuGet package manager GUI in Visual Studio (prior to 2015) does not let you
  specify the version of a package you wish to install (or upgrade to). Since
  there are later pre-release builds of the Visual Studio runner on NuGet.org,
  you will need to use the  Package Manager Console window inside Visual Studio
  to install this build. To do so, show the console via
  <code>View > Other Windows > Package Manager Console</code>, then type the
  following command into the console window:<br />
  <br />
  <code>Update-Package xunit.runner.visualstudio -Version 2.0.1-rc1-build1078</code><br />
  <br/>
  This will update the Visual Studio runner package reference in all test projects
  in the currently open solution.

<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>BUG:</strong> Fixed an issue when running xUnit.net 1.9.2 tests where
    where theories would sometimes not correctly show all results, despite being
    run. Test totals, test results, and test icon indicators in Test Explorer
    should now all be working as expected.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>BUG:</strong> Test discovery failures were being reported with error
    messages, which caused Team Build to report projects with mixed .NET and
    C/C++ projects to be "Partially Successful", even though all appropriate
    unit tests passed.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>BUG:</strong> Diagnostic message output was missing the xUnit.net
    banner and execution time.
  </li>
</ul>
