<h2>Release Notes</h2>

<p>These release notes are a comprehensive list of changes from 2.6.2 to 2.6.3.</p>

<h3>Assertion library</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    Attempts to call equality comparison (<code>Assert.Equal</code> and <code>Assert.NotEqual</code>)
    with the overload that takes a comparison function, while comparing two sets (that is, any
    collection implementing <code>ISet&lt;T&gt;</code> or <code>IReadOnlySet&lt;T&gt;</code>) will
    now throw. Previously the behavior was undefined. The reasoning behind this inspired a new
    documentation page (<a href="/docs/hash-sets-vs-linear-containers">"Equality with hash sets vs.
    linear containers"</a>), which describes the reasoning behind this change.
  </li>
  <li>
    The order of precedence for equality assertion now places implementation of
    <code>IEquatable&lt;T&gt;</code> higher than attempting to treat items as containers.
    This allows developers who want to customize container comparison to implement
    this interface. Note that all other comparison interfaces remain lower priority,
    so this is the only supported interface for customized container comparison.

  </li>
  <li>
    Overloads of <code>Assert.Contains</code> and <code>Assert.DoesNotContain</code> for
    <code>SortedSet&lt;T&gt;</code> and <code>ImmutableSortedSet&lt;T&gt;</code> have been
    added, to help deal with compiler ambiguity.

  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>BUG:</strong> Fixed an issue where <code>null</code> values in dictionaries weren't
    being properly compared.

  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Runner utility</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    Several "delegating sink" classes were deprecated, and combined into a single new class
    (<a href="https://github.com/xunit/xunit/blob/v2/src/xunit.runner.utility/Sinks/ExecutionSink.cs"><code>ExecutionSink</code></a>)
    which performs all the duties of the previously separate classes. These classes already had
    strong ordering dependencies on one another, and the current implementation of those classes
    were causing an issue where sometimes XML output was missing, due to a race condition. For
    an example of the changes to use the new class, please see
    <a href="https://github.com/xunit/visualstudio.xunit/commit/56db5de6cece6ca1341664ceece0a1e186dceca8">this
    commit</a> which updates the Visual Studio adapter to use the new class.

</ul>
