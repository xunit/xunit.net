<h2>
  xUnit.net v2 2.5.1 Pre-Release (build 12)
</h2>

<p>
  This release fixes the reference to <code>xunit.analzyers</code> (build 11 was mistakenly still referencing the 1.2.0
  RTM version of the analyzers). There are no other changes; please consult the <a href="2.5.1-pre.11">2.5.1-pre.11</a>
  release notes for the changes from 2.5.0.
</p>
