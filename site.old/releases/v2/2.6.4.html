<h2>Release Notes</h2>

<p>These release notes are a comprehensive list of changes from 2.6.3 to 2.6.4.</p>

<h3>Assertion library</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>BUG:</strong> Fixed an issue introduced with the preference for <code>IEquatable&lt;T&gt;</code>
    over <code>IEnumerable&lt;T&gt;</code> when the value types in a dictionary were of differing
    types. This manifested as an <code>InvalidCastException</code> being thrown while trying to compare
    values in the dictionary against each other.

  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Runner utility</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>BUG:</strong> Fixed a race condition introduced by <code>ExecutionSink</code> in
    2.6.3 which was causing runners to sometimes trigger an <code>ObjectDisposedException</code>
    while finishing running an assembly. This was more easily reproduced in low CPU thread
    count conditions (more common in CI environments than developer machines).
