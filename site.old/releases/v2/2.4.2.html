<h1>Release Notes: August 1, 2022</h1>

<a href="https://www.dotnetfoundation.org/"><img align="right" src="/images/dotnet-fdn-logo.png" width="100" /></a>

<h2>Hello, v2 2.4.2!</h2>

<p>
  Today, we're shipping xUnit.net 2.4.2; this includes RTM builds of the core
  framework and analyzers (now at version 1.0.0! ðŸŽ‰).
</p>

<p>
  It's been nearly 4 years since the release of <a href="2.4.1">2.4.1 RTM</a>.
  This release includes a few targeted bug fixes for the core framework, and
  an updated assertion library with many of the new v3 assertions being
  back-ported to v2. This new assertion library includes several new assertions
  and overloads of existing assertions, improvements to output for failing tests,
  and nullable annotations.
</p>

<p>
  We did not intend to ship any more v2 releases; that said, we also did not intend
  for the v3 development process to take as long as it has. We felt it was necessary
  to address a couple specific high-friction issues (including two from the .NET Team at
  Microsoft); the new assertions are merely an extra reason to encourage the upgrade (and
  help tide teams over who might be waiting for v3 with some of the new features).
</p>

<p>
  You will notice that we have not changed any of the minimum requirements for
  this release, despite the fact that .NET 4.5.2 and .NET Core 1.0 are quite old
  at this point. We did not want to disrupt the workflow of those who may still
  be stuck on older (even out of support) versions of .NET Framework or .NET Core.
  <em>You should not consider this an endorsement that you use these older
  versions of .NET Framework or .NET Core; this was merely about making as few
  changes as possible to minimize compatibility issues, especially with third party
  extensibility libraries and test runners. <strong>Please upgrade to supported
  versions as soon as possible, as some of them are not even receiving security patches
  at this point in time.</strong></em>
</p>

<p>
  This need to stick to the older target frameworks is the reason we are unable
  to ship the new assertions based on <code>Span</code>, <code>Memory</code> and
  <code>ValueTask</code>. If you wish you be able to consume these, they are part
  of the source package <code>xunit.assert.source</code>, which you could use
  (instead of <code>xunit.assert</code>), and then define the appropriate constants
  in the project (using
  <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/msbuild/common-msbuild-project-properties">&lt;DefineConstants&gt;</a>
  in your project file) to enable more advanced features. For more information on the
  constants and available features, please see the
  <a href="https://github.com/xunit/assert.xunit#annotations">Assertion library</a>
  home page README.
</p>

<p>
  As always, we'd like to thank all the users who contributed to the success of
  xUnit.net through usage, feedback, and code contributions.
</p>

<h2>Release Notes</h2>

<p><em>
  These release notes reflect the entirety of the changes between 2.4.1 and 2.4.2.
</em></p>

<h3>Core framework</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>BUG:</strong> Fixed an issue where placing <code>Skip</code> on an
    <code>[InlineData]</code> attribute was being ignored by Visual Studio Test Explorer.
    <a class="issue-link" href="https://github.com/xunit/visualstudio.xunit/issues/266">xunit/visualstudio.xunit#266</a>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>BUG:</strong> Fixed an issue where <code>decimal</code> values weren't
    usable in generic theories because the type coercion logic was not accounting for
    the possibility of multiple type-compatible <code>op_Implicit</code> or
    <code>op_Explicit</code> methods.
    <a class="issue-link" href="https://github.com/xunit/xunit/issues/2418">xunit/xunit#2418</a>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>BUG:</strong> Fixed an issue where type inference for generic test methods
    was not done correctly when one of the test data values was <code>null</code> (it
    would incorrectly use <code>object</code> to close all the generic types rather than
    continuing to inspect the subsequent non-<code>null</code> values for their
    correct types).
    <a class="issue-link" href="https://github.com/xunit/xunit/issues/2401">xunit/xunit#2401</a>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>BUG:</strong> Fixed a bug in <code>DisposalTracker</code> which was a race
    condition that could cause objects to fail to get disposed and/or cause objects to
    get disposed twice.
    <a class="issue-link" href="https://github.com/xunit/xunit/issues/1855">xunit/xunit#1855</a>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Assertion library</h3>

<h4>New assertions</h4>
<ul>
  <li>
    Added <code>Assert.Distinct</code> to verify that a collection does not contain any duplicate values.
    <a class="issue-link" href="https://github.com/xunit/assert.xunit/pull/35">xunit/assert.xunit#35</a>
  </li>
  <li>
    Added <code>Assert.Equivalent</code> to check for object equivalence. Object equivalence
    is intended to be a looser kind of assertion than <code>Assert.Equal</code>. This assertion
    allows an optional <code>strict</code> flag to influence its behavior. The rules for equivalence
    are as follows:
    <ul>
      <li>
        <code>null</code> values are only ever equivalent to other <code>null</code> values (regardless
        of <code>strict</code>).
      </li>
      <li>
        For value types and strings, equivalence and equality are the same (regardless of <code>strict</code>).
        In particular, this means that types must match exactly (for example, <code>int</code> and
        <code>long</code> values are never equivalent, even if they have the same underlying value; or,
        in code form: <code>Assert.Equivalent(12, 12L);</code> will fail).
      </li>
      <li>
        For collections, the items in the two collections are compared for equivalence <em>regardless of their
        order in the collection</em> (meaning <code>[1, 2]</code> is equivalent to <code>[2, 1]</code>) and
        <em>regardless of the collection type</em> (for example, <code>List&lt;int&gt;</code> can be compared
        against <code>int[]</code>). The <code>strict</code> parameter influences this comparison by requiring
        that all values in the <code>expected</code> list are in the <code>actual</code> list (meaning
        <code>expected: [1, 2]</code> is equivalent to <code>actual: [2, 3, 1]</code> when <code>strict</code>
        is <code>false</code>, but <em>not equivalent</em> when <code>strict</code> is <code>true</code>). Another
        way to think of this is that <code>strict: false</code> allows <code>actual</code> to be a <em>strict
        superset</em> of <code>expected</code>, whereas <code>strict: true</code> does not.
      </li>
      <li>
        Reference types which point to the same instance are always equivalent (regardless of <code>strict</code>).
        Circular references are not allowed, and will be surfaced as test failures. For all other reference types,
        the public non-static fields and readable properties are compared for equivalence <em>without regard to the
        types of the two values</em> and <em>without regard to which values came from fields vs. properties</em>.
        Like collections, the <code>strict</code> flag indicates whether <code>actual</code> is allowed to be a
        strict superset of <code>expected</code> (<code>strict: false</code>) or an exact match (<code>strict:
        true</code>). Reference types inspected in this way determine the equivalence of individual field/property
        values by using these same sets of rules when comparing the field/property values. This includes reference
        type values (meaning the reference type equivalence is considered to be "deep", not "shallow").
      </li>
      <li>
        <code>KeyValuePair&lt;,&gt;</code> is handled specially: the keys are checked for equivalence
        against each other, as are the values; this allows embedded collections inside of keys and/or
        values inside a KeyValuePair.
      </li>
    </ul>
    It's somewhat challenging to describe these rules in plain English, so please see the comprehensive
    test suite linked below for codified versions of all these rules.
    <a class="issue-link" href="https://github.com/xunit/xunit/issues/1604">xunit/xunit#1604</a>
    <a class="issue-link" href="https://github.com/xunit/xunit/blob/f110e5bee5dfd4c08339587c9c3df9292fcb597c/test/test.xunit.assert/Asserts/EquivalenceAssertsTests.cs">Assert.Equivalent test suite</a>
  </li>
  <li>
    Added <code>Assert.Fail</code> which unilaterally fails the test with the given message.
    <a class="issue-link" href="https://github.com/xunit/xunit/issues/2105">xunit/xunit#2105</a>
  </li>
  <li>
    Added <code>Assert.Multiple</code> which allows the developer to run several independent
    assertions (expressed as <code>Action</code>s) and then collect up all the failures into
    a single failure. This behavior differs from the default behavior (which stops running
    assertions upon the first failure).
    <a class="issue-link" href="https://github.com/xunit/xunit/issues/1920">xunit/xunit#1920</a>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>New overloads</h4>
<ul>
  <li>
    Added an overload of <code>Assert.All</code> which takes an <code>Action&lt;T, int&gt;</code> so
    the inspecting action get access to both the value and its index in the collection.
    <a class="issue-link" href="https://github.com/xunit/xunit/issues/2082">xunit/xunit#2082</a>
  </li>
  <li>
    Add overload of <code>Assert.Equal</code> for doubles which includes a <code>MidpointRounding</code>
    flag.
    <a class="issue-link" href="https://github.com/xunit/xunit/issues/2074">xunit/xunit#2074</a>
  </li>
  <li>
    Add overload of <code>Assert.Equal</code> for floats and doubles that allows specifying a
    tolerance (rather than a precision).
    <a class="issue-link" href="https://github.com/xunit/xunit/issues/1293">xunit/xunit#1293</a>
    <a class="issue-link" href="https://github.com/xunit/xunit/issues/1984">xunit/xunit#1984</a>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>Message improvement</h4>
<ul>
  <li>
    Improved the output of <code>Assert.Collection</code> with a pointer-style message (like string
    assertions) that make it easier to identify the failing part of the collection.
    <a class="issue-link" href="https://github.com/xunit/xunit/issues/994">xunit/xunit#994</a>
    <a class="issue-link" href="https://github.com/xunit/xunit/issues/1924">xunit/xunit#1924</a>
  </li>
  <li>
    Improved the output of <code>Assert.Empty</code> to match other expected/actual exceptions.
    <a class="issue-link" href="https://github.com/xunit/xunit/issues/1806">xunit/xunit#1806</a>
  </li>
  <li>
    Improved the output of <code>Assert.Single</code> to improve the output message when
    being used with a "match" expression (it used to say the collection was empty, but
    now correctly mentions the fact that you were matching specific values).
    <a class="issue-link" href="https://github.com/xunit/assert.xunit/pull/28">xunit/assert.xunit#28</a>
  </li>
  <li>
    Improved the output from exceptions which show expected and actual values which are multi-line
    values, so that the lines are properly indented.
    <a class="issue-link" href="https://github.com/xunit/xunit/commit/8b67420306018ca37f6cd91a65a559a381964829">xunit/xunit commit 8b67420</a>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>Bugs fixed</h4>
<ul>
  <li>
    Updated the white space list <code>Assert.Equal</code> for strings with <code>ignoreWhiteSpace: true</code>.
    <a class="issue-link" href="https://github.com/xunit/xunit/issues/1931">xunit/xunit#1931</a>
  </li>
  <li>
    There are times during <code>Assert.Equal</code> with collections that can iterate multiple times
    (which is generally considered bad form with <code>IEnumerable</code>). The most egregious case of
    this was fixed, though there is still at least one more possibility during test failure to end
    up enumerating a second time.
    <a class="issue-link" href="https://github.com/xunit/xunit/issues/2402">xunit/xunit#2402</a>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>Other improvements</h4>
<ul>
  <li>
    All appropriate assertions have been annotated for nullability:
    <ul>
      <li>
        <code>Assert.NotNull</code> tells the compiler that the <code>object</code> parameter will
        not <code>null</code> if the function doesn't throw. <code>Assert.Null</code> similarly
        tells the compiler that the <code>object</code> parameter may be <code>null</code> if
        the function doesn't throw.
      </li>
      <li>
        <code>Assert.Contains</code> and <code>Assert.DoesNotContain</code> for dictionaries requires
        the dictionary key type to be non-nullable.
      </li>
      <li>
        <code>Assert.Single</code> against non-generic <code>IEnumerable</code> indicates the return
        value may be <code>null</code>.
      </li>
      <li>
        Many assertion parameters were updated to indicate when <code>null</code> parameter values
        are acceptable and when they aren't, as well as updating return signatures to indicate when
        returned values may or may not be <code>null</code>.
      </li>
      <li>
        A few assertions (<code>True</code>, <code>False</code>, and <code>Fail</code>) are marked as
        never returning (aka, throwing) based on the input data.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    Marked <code>XunitException</code>'s constructors which take inner exceptions as <code>public</code>.
    <a class="issue-link" href="https://github.com/xunit/assert.xunit/pull/33">xunit/assert.xunit#33</a>
  </li>
  <li>
    The event assertions (<code>Assert.Raises</code>, <code>Assert.RaisesAny</code>, and
    <code>Assert.RaisesAsync</code>) no longer express type requirements for <code>EventArgs</code>.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Runner utility (and all runners)</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>BUG:</strong> Updated the output when running tests inside TeamCity to improve the way
    TeamCity parsed test output (missing its flow ID and a flag to indicate the text was parsable).
    <a class="issue-link" href="https://github.com/xunit/xunit/issues/2397">xunit/xunit#2397</a>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>BUG:</strong> Fixed in issue with incorrect lock order when coloring console
    output.
    <a class="issue-link" href="https://github.com/xunit/xunit/pull/2228">xunit/xunit#2228</a>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>A note about <code>xunit.runner.visualstudio</code></h2>

<p>
  Visual Studio does not allow mixed versions of this package in your solution, so do not mix versions; doing
  so may cause problems running your projects that need the older version of the runner package. Choose the
  lowest version of the package that applies to <em>all</em> of the test projects in your solution.
</p>
