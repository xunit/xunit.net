<h2>
  xUnit.net v2 2.5.1 Pre-Release (build 11)
</h2>

<p>
  This is co-released with
  <code>xunit.analyzers</code> version <a href="/releases/analyzers/1.3.0-pre.6"><code>1.3.0-pre.6</code></a> and
  <code>xunit.runner.visualstudio</code> version <a href="/releases/visualstudio/2.5.1-pre.4"><code>2.5.1-pre.4</code></a>.
</p>

<p>
  The 2.5.1 release will be primarily focused on fixing issues introduced with the newly overhauled assertion
  library, as well as integrating in any other bug fixes along the way that we've discovered.
</p>

<p class="note">
  Users have reported sporadic problems restoring the version 2.5.0 NuGet packages. This is a result of .NET Foundation's
  code signing system changing the default time stamp server from DigiCert to Microsoft, which is not supported on .NET SDK
  6.0.3xx (which is associated with Visual Studio 2022 LTS release 17.2). Users who were trying to stick with purely LTS
  builds of tools experienced <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/reference/errors-and-warnings/nu3003">NU3003</a>
  ("The package signature is invalid or cannot be verified on this platform."). We have manually reverted back to the
  DigiCert time stamp service, which will allow users relying on LTS tooling to be able to restore our packages again.<br />
  <br />
  At this point in time, it is unclear whether this will be fixable for .NET SDK 6.0.3xx or not (and whether the proposed
  fix in <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/issues/33928">this issue</a> will actually work on all OSes or just
  Windows). Regardless of whether this change is applied or not, it is our intention to permanently stick with the DigiCert
  time stamp service because it provides maximum compatibility with currently shipping versions of the SDK.

<h3>Assertion library</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    The <code>BitArray</code> class has been marked as "safe to re-enumerate", so when it is printed in error messages
    and/or theory data, it will show the bit values (as an array of <code>True</code> and <code>False</code>) rather
    than the placeholder <code>[&#xB7;&#xB7;&#xB7;]</code>.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>BUG:</strong> Fixed an issue where proper nullable annotations were accidentally left off of the new
    <code>Assert.NotNull&lt;T&gt;()</code> overload designed for nullable value types.

  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>BUG:</strong> Fixed a regression in <code>Assert.Equal</code> with dictionaries where the <code>TValue</code>
    was a collection class (like an array or <code>List&lt;T&gt;</code>).
    <a class="issue-link" href="https://github.com/xunit/xunit/issues/2755">xunit/xunit#2755</a>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>BUG:</strong> Fixed an issue with <code>Assert.Equal</code> with <code>HashSet</code> values, where the
    internal comparer (passed during construction of the <code>HashSet</code>) and/or the external comparer (passed
    to <code>Assert.Equal</code>) was not being used, causing false positives or negatives. Part of the implementation
    of this fix also resolves a potential issue (never reported) with internal type <code>AssertEqualityComparerAdapter</code>
    and an implementation of <code>GetHashCode</code> that was throwing; it now correctly delegates to the instance
    of <code>IEqualityComparer&lt;T&gt;</code> that it is wrapping.

  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>BUG:</strong> Fixed an issue with <code>Assert.Equivalent</code> with some tuple values where the comparison
    was failing, even when the values should've been equivalent. This involved rewriting some sketchy logic related to
    <code>IComparable</code> which had previously been added just to support <code>DateTime</code> and <code>DateTimeOffset</code>;
    now, instead, we explicitly handle those two types and never try to use <code>IComparable</code>. This is more in line
    with the originally intended purpose of <code>Assert.Equivalent</code>, but it may now surface as unexpected false
    negatives if any developers were relying on us calling their <code>IComparable</code> implementation. The new logic is
    the correct intention, and developers should not assume that we will use <code>IComparable</code> (or any other
    similar interface) for <code>Assert.Equivalent</code>. Note that this <em>does not affect</em> our implementation
    of <code>Assert.Equal</code>, which still consults several equality-testing interfaces.

<h3>Extensibility</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>BUG:</strong> Fixed an issue where the factory methods in the assert library's exception classes were not all
    properly marked as public as intended.
