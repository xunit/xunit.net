Today, we're shipping one new release and two new prereleases:

* **xUnit.net Core Framework v2 `2.9.1`**
* xUnit.net Core Framework v3 `0.4.0-pre.20` ([release notes](/releases/v3/0.4.0-pre.20))
* xUnit.net Visual Studio adapter `3.0.0-pre.35`  ([release notes](/releases/visualstudio/3.0.0-pre.35))

It's been 3 months since the release of [`2.9.0`](2.9.0).

As always, we'd like to thank all the users who contributed to the success of xUnit.net through usage, feedback, and code contributions. ðŸŽ‰

## Release Notes

These release notes are a comprehensive list of changes from `2.9.0` to `2.9.1`.

### Core Framework

* We have added collection initializer support for `TheoryData<T>`, so that you can now write the following code to initialize a `TheoryData<T>`:

   ```csharp
   public static TheoryData<int> IntValues = [42, 2112, 2600];
   ```

   Note that this changes `TheoryData<T>` such that the "primary" enumeration implementation is `IEnumerable<T>`, so any code that was previously depending on it returning `IEnumerable<object[]>` may need to be rewritten (i.e., casting the data to `IEnumerable<object[]>` explicitly before enumerating).

* We have updated the JUnit XML report output based on [https://github.com/testmoapp/junitxml?tab=readme-ov-file](https://github.com/testmoapp/junitxml?tab=readme-ov-file), which should provide a more up-to-date report result. [xunit/xunit#2979](https://github.com/xunit/xunit/issues/2979){: .issue-link }

* **BUG:** We have restored a mistakenly removed method (`TestInvoker<T>.GetTaskFromResult`), albeit hidden from Intellisense. The correct method to use moving forward is `AsyncUtility.TryConvertToTask`, which provides the same functionality as the restored method. [xunit/xunit#3026](https://github.com/xunit/xunit/discussions/3026){: .issue-link }

### Assertion Library

* We have added support for `Guid` values to `Assert.Equivalent`. [xunit/xunit#2974](https://github.com/xunit/xunit/issues/2974){: .issue-link }

* We have added support for `Lazy<T>` values to `Assert.Equivalent`. When encountered anywhere in the expected and/or actual side of the comparison, the underlying value will be compared.

* We have added support for `IEnumerable<IGrouping<TKey, TValue>>` to `Assert.Equivalent`. We have also added support for this to `ArgumentFormatter`, which should allow properly displaying groupings rather than falling back to the triple-ellipses display. (Note: Using `Assert.Equal` with groupings will cause false positives due of the fact `IGrouping<>` implements `IEnumerable<TValue>`, so the containers only compare values and not keys. Only `Assert.Equivalent` is supported for comparing two groupings.) [xunit/xunit#3028](https://github.com/xunit/xunit/issues/3028){: .issue-link }

* **BUG:** We have fixed an issue with compiler ambiguity related to arrays and spans (for .NET 6+ users) by adding an additional overload (`Equal<T>(ReadOnlySpan<T>, T[]`). [xunit/xunit#3021](https://github.com/xunit/xunit/issues/3021){: .issue-link }
