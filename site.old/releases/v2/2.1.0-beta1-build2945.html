<h1>Release Notes: March 21, 2015</h1>

<a href="https://www.dotnetfoundation.org/"><img align="right" src="/images/dotnet-fdn-logo.png" width="100" /></a>

<h2>xUnit.net v2 2.1 Beta 1</h2>

<h3>Core framework</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Added support for ASP.NET 5 Beta 3.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Extensibility</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    <code>TestInvoker.InvokeTestMethodAsync</code> was accidentally made public
    just before the 2.0 release. It has been restored back to protected, as was
    originally intended.
  </li>
  <li>
    <code>TestCollection.Serialize</code> and <code>TestCollection.Deserialize</code>
    has been made virtual, so developers can re-use the implementation while
    enhancing the serialization behavior.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>BUG:</strong> <code>TestInvoker</code> would invoke unit tests even if
    the user had requested cancellation. This has been fixed.
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Visual Studio Runner 2.1 Beta 1</h2>

<p><em>
  For information on using xUnit.net from within Visual Studio, see

<ul>

</ul>

<ul>
  <li>Added support for ASP.NET 5 Beta 3.</li>

    has been validated with VS 2015 CTP 6.

  </li>
</ul>
