<h2>Hello, v2 2.3.1!</h2>

<p>
  Today, we're shipping xUnit.net 2.3.1. This is primarily a bug fix release. The
  complete list of issues fixed since 2.3 is listed below.
</p>

<h2>What's New</h2>

<h3>Core framework</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    Removed external dependencies. This primarily caused issues with developers who wanted to use a newer
    version of JSON.NET than we were linked against (9.0.1), but also affected uses of
    <code>Microsoft.DotNet.InternalAbstractions</code> and
    <code>Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyModel</code>.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>dotnet xunit runner</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Optimized assembly resolution lookup performance.</li>
  <li>
    Made the <code>-quiet</code> switch cause less output from <code>dotnet xunit</code> itself, as well
    as switching the default MSBuild verbosity to <code>quiet</code>.
  </li>
  <li>
    When exiting with Ctrl+C, the standard Windows exit code (<code>0xC000013A</code>, or <code>-1073741510</code>)
    is now correctly used. In addition, Ctrl+C handling has been improved (for example, when attempting to stop during
    a build, the runner would previously move onto the next target framework instead of immediately stopping).
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>BUG:</strong> Fixed an issue where hitting Ctrl+C did not correctly terminate all the
    child processes created by <code>dotnet xunit</code>.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>BUG:</strong> Assembly resolution sometimes failed on case-sensitive file systems (this
    primarily affected Linux users, as Windows and OS X by default use case-preserving but
    case-insensitive file systems).
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>BUG:</strong> Unmanaged library lookup would sometimes fail because of names which didn't
    match the filename (for example, asking for 'foo' but the library is really 'libfoo'). This primarily
    affected Linux and OS X users where dynamic libraries tend to have prefixes like 'lib'.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Console runner</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    When exiting with Ctrl+C, the standard Windows exit code (<code>0xC000013A</code>, or <code>-1073741510</code>)
    is now correctly used.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>BUG:</strong> Fixed an issue where the XML results file was being over-written without
    erasing the old contents, the end result of which could be corrupted XML files.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>MSBuild runner</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>BUG:</strong> Fixed an issue where MSBuild runner reporters were not working. This was
    most obviously affecting TeamCity and AppVeyor users who lost their test reporting.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>BUG:</strong> The XML results output file was being left open longer than intended. Now
    it should be closed by the time the <code>&lt;xunit&gt;</code> task has completed.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>BUG:</strong> All reports other than XML v2 (for example, HTML and NUnit) were failing
    to output correctly, instead causing a null reference exception.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Visual Studio runner</h3>
<p><em>
  For information on using xUnit.net from within Visual Studio, see
  <a href="/docs/getting-started-desktop.html#run-tests-visualstudio">Running
  tests with Visual Studio</a> in the Getting Started documentation.
</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>BUG:</strong> Fixed issues with the performance-optimized serialization that were
    causing <code>[Fact]</code> tests to be broken with Live Unit Testing.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>BUG:</strong> Fixed an issue where test classes with mixed facts and theories
    and class/collection fixtures ended up with two fixtures being created (one for the
    facts and one for the theories).
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>BUG:</strong> Fixed an issue where sometimes source file mappings were broken,
    especially with projects whose name started with 'n'. (Yes, really.)
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Runner reporters</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>BUG:</strong> Fixed an issue with the JSON reporter which caused floating point numbers
    to use the current computer's locale to format numbers, instead of the invariant locale. This
    caused invalid JSON to be generated on systems which use non-period decimal separators.
  </li>
</ul>
