<h1>Release Notes: April 27, 2024</h1>

<a href="https://www.dotnetfoundation.org/"><img align="right" src="/images/dotnet-fdn-logo.png" width="100" /></a>

<p>Today, we're shipping three new releases:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>xUnit.net Core Framework v2 2.8.0</strong></li>
  <li>xUnit.net Analyzers 1.13.0 (<a href="/releases/analyzers/1.13.0">release notes</a>)</li>
  <li>xUnit.net Visual Studio adapter 2.8.0 (<a href="/releases/visualstudio/2.8.0">release notes</a>)</li>
</ul>

<p>It's been 2 weeks since the release of <a href="2.7.1">2.7.1 RTM</a>.</p>

<p class="note">
  This release has been numbered as <code>2.8.0</code> rather than <code>2.7.2</code> because it includes
  an important change to the default behavior of the system with respect to how parallel tests are run.
  While we don't anticipate this being a problem (and we believe, in fact, that the new system solves a
  previous problem with accurate timing and <code>[Fact(Timeout = n)]</code> not being reliable when tests
  were run in parallel), it was still important enough to warrant the version bump.<br />
  <br />
  For more information about this change in parallel algorithms (including how to revert back to the older
  algorithm, if you so choose), see the <a href="/docs/running-tests-in-parallel#algorithms">Algorithms section
  of the "Running Tests in Parallel"</a> documentation.
</p>

<p>
  As always, we'd like to thank all the users who contributed to the success of xUnit.net through
  usage, feedback, and code. We would especially like to thank <a href="https://github.com/mconnew">Matt Connew</a>
  for working through the details of the new algorithm. ðŸŽ‰
</p>

<h2>Release Notes</h2>

<p>These release notes are a comprehensive list of changes from 2.7.1 to 2.8.0.</p>

<h3>Core Framework</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    As mentioned above, there is a new default parallelism algorithm. The work for this was done primarily while
    chasing down deadlock and failing test issues that users were experiencing after upgrading to 2.7.0. Related,
    we have also rolled back one of the changes that went into 2.7.0: the conditional disabling of the
    <code>AsyncTestSyncContext</code>. It was discovered that some situations were made worse in terms of deadlocks
    and test failures when there were no sync contexts in place, because of the overloaded list of tasks that
    were scheduled, and the sync context was inadvertently releasing some of that pressure.

  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>BUG:</strong> There was a potential race condition in our assembly lookup cache because of a use
    of a non-thread-safe dictionary.
    <a class="issue-link" href="https://github.com/xunit/visualstudio.xunit/pull/407">xunit/visualstudio.xunit#407</a>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>BUG:</strong> There was a bug in our ETW code that send a <code>TestStart</code> event twice rather
    than a <code>TestStart</code> followed by a <code>TestStop</code>.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Runners</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    The console runner has added a new <code>-useansicolor</code> switch which will force the runner to use
    ANSI color codes rather than the direct console color system, when running on Windows systems (non-Windows
    systems always use ANSI colors). This allows users who redirect or capture the output to be able to include
    colors in their capture. It is important to note that the default <code>CMD</code> or <code>PowerShell</code>
    windows which are hosted by CONHOST do <strong>not</strong> support ANSI colors, so you will see the raw
    ANSI codes; <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/terminal/install">Windows Terminal</a> does
    correctly display ANSI colors.
    <a class="issue-link" href="https://github.com/xunit/xunit/issues/783">xunit/xunit#783</a>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Runner Utility</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    We have back-ported from v3 support for a "multiplier" thread count syntax which can be used in command
    line switches and configuration files. For more information, see <a href="/docs/configuration-files#maxParallelThreads">the
    <code>maxParallelThreads</code> section</a> of the configuration file documentation.
  </li>
  <li>
    The default runner reporter will now display <code>/aggressive</code> tacked onto the max thread count (when
    diagnostic messages are on) when the aggressive parallelism algorithm is enabled.
  </li>
</ul>
