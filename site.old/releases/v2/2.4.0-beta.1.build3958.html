<h2>xUnit.net v2 2.4 Beta 1</h2>

<h3>Core framework</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    A new feature called "test method display options" is available. This features some built-in transformations
    of test names automatically, in an attempt to generate more readable test names. This comprises a set of flags
    that can be enabled for individual transformations. For more information, see the <code>methodDisplayOptions</code>
    section of <a href="/docs/configuration-files">Configuration Files</a>.
  </li>
  <li>
    Support for reporting tests to VSTS has been added. Like our support for TeamCity and AppVeyor, this is a reporter
    that is automatically enabled when tests are running inside of VSTS. Documentation on how to enable this (with
    a sample YAML build definition) will be forthcoming shortly.
  </li>
  <li>
    Data theories can now pass <code>DateTime</code>, <code>DateTimeOffset</code>, and <code>Guid</code> values
    as strings, and they will be converted automatically to the matching argument type. This is most useful
    with <code>[InlineData]</code>, which does not allow any of these types natively.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>BUG:</strong> Fixed an issue where implicit and explicit conversion operator methods were not always
    used when converting theory data.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>BUG:</strong> JSON configuration for <code>maxParallelThreads</code> did not properly support the special
    values of <code>0</code> and <code>-1</code>.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>BUG:</strong> Fixed an issue with some incorrectly escaped characters when reporting to TeamCity
    (which caused some test names to get mangled or truncated).
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Assertion library</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>BUG:</strong> Fixed an issue when <code>Assert.All</code> encountered a <code>null</code>
    data element.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Console runner</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    Swapped <code>-noappdomain</code> for <code>-appdomains [required|ifavailable|denied]</code>, to
    better align with the values from configuration files. The old switch is still supported, but no
    longer listed in the help page. The default value is <code>ifavailable</code>.
  </li>
  <li>
    Updated <code>-help</code> to show that <code>-method</code> can take wildcards.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>BUG:</strong> Fixed an issue where invoking the console runner without arguments could throw
    an exception rather than showing the help page.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>dotnet xunit runner</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    When targeting <code>netcoreapp2.0</code> or later, you can now generate the full set of output
    reports: HTML, XML v1, XML v2, and NUnit 2.5. (When targeting <code>netcoreapp1.0</code>, you are
    still limited to just XML v2 reports.)
  </li>
  <li>
    Swapped <code>-noappdomain</code> for <code>-appdomains [required|ifavailable|denied]</code>, to
    better align with the values from configuration files. The old switch is still supported, but no
    longer listed in the help page. The default value is <code>ifavailable</code>.
  </li>
  <li>
    Updated <code>-help</code> to show that <code>-method</code> can take wildcards.
  </li>
  <li>Optimized (and cached) assembly resolution for .NET Core projects.</li>
  <li>
    <strong>BUG:</strong> Fixed issues related to running on operating systems that were currently
    unknown to .NET Core (for example, macOS 10.13). This usually surfaced as an inability to load
    platform-specific assemblies when running on these platforms.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>BUG:</strong> Fixed issues related to libraries not loading from the dependency list. This surfaced
    most commonly as failures with MVC TestHost.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>BUG:</strong> Fixed an issue related to .NET SDK 2.0.3 which was causing failures to find the
    <code>2.0</code> runtime (when the <code>2.0.0</code> runtime was the one desired).
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>BUG:</strong> Fixed an issue with using relative paths instead of absolute paths when setting
    the working directory for executing tests.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>MSBuild runner</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    Updated the <code>AppDomains='value'</code> attribute to accept all the legal values (<code>required</code>,
    <code>ifavailable</code>, and <code>denied</code>), to better align with the values from configuration files.
    This was previously a boolean value, so the old values are still supported (<code>true</code> maps to
    <code>required</code>, and <code>false</code> maps to <code>denied</code>). The default value is
    <code>ifavailable</code>.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>BUG:</strong> The <code>FailSkips</code> attribute was previously not settable. This
    has been fixed.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>VSTest plugin (for dotnet test and Visual Studio Test Explorer)</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    The RunSettings file can now include a reporter (i.e., <code>quiet</code>, <code>teamcity</code>, etc.)
    The element is at <code>/RunSettings/RunConfiguration/ReporterSwitch</code>, with the reporter switch
    name being the inner text of the element (i.e.,
    <code>&lt;ReporterSwitch&gt;quiet&lt;/ReporterSwitch&gt;</code>).
  </li>
  <li>
    Experimental support for Test Platform v2 with UWP has been added, for future Visual Studio releases.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>BUG:</strong> In some cases, having a trait with an empty value caused test discovery and/or
    execution failure.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>BUG:</strong> Fixed an issue with test method names that contained colons. This was most commonly
    seen with F# tests.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>BUG:</strong> Fixed an issue where passing incompatible test method data to params arrays on
    data theories caused test discovery to fail (and would show as forever discovering in the Test Explorer UI).
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Extensibility</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    The reflection abstraction for CLR attributes now allows field setters (in addition to property setters)
    when reflecting on attribute constructor arguments. While there were no attributes in xUnit.net itself
    that used field setters, this will allow extensibility authors to write custom extension attributes that
    use fields rather than properties for optional attribute arguments.
  </li>
</ul>
