<h2>What's New</h2>

<p>
  Unlike traditional release notes (which cover incremental builds from previous
  drops), these will cover the major design shift from v1 to v2, and some
  discussion about what motivated some of these changes. The first thing to
  make clear: we will continue to support 1.9.2 through our new 2.0 runners,
  so your upgrade path is incremental. We have no plans to release any fixes
  for 1.9.2 unless they are complete showstoppers, but given its age, we don't
  expect that to ever happen.
</p>
<p>
  One of the reasons that this process took so long is that there is almost no
  code in the framework itself that remains from the v1 timeframe, other than
  some of the assertion library. From an internal implementation standpoint (and
  an extensibility standpoint), this is an entirely new product.
</p>

<h3>Consumability</h3>

<p>
  The #1 feature for xUnit.net v2 was to improve consumability. To us, that
  falls into several separate but related buckets of functionality:
</p>

<p>
  <strong>More Platforms.</strong> xUnit.net 1.x only directly supported
  writing and running unit tests on the desktop CLR. For 2.0, we have
  added support for Portable Class Libraries, Universal Applications
  (those that target Windows Phone 8.1, Windows 8.1, and Windows 10),
  Modern Windows 8 Applications, Windows Phone 8 Silverlight Applications,
  MonoAndroid Applications, MonoTouch Applications, and iOS Unified
  Applications. In addition, in 2.1 we are shipping support for ASP.NET
  5 projects running on Windows, Linux, and OS X.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Separated Assertions.</strong> A common theme among xUnit.net users
  was that they wanted the ability to choose assertion libraries other than
  ours. In 2.0, we have separated the core framework from the assertion
  library, and we offer the asserts in either binary or source form. By
  bringing in assertions as source, you can extend the <code>Assert</code>
  class itself with your own assertion methods.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>No more installers.</strong> We moved to a NuGet based distribution
  model in 1.7, and with 2.0, we've finally cut ties with all other
  distribution mechanisms. Even support for running tests inside of
  Visual Studio is shipped as NuGet package!
</p>
<p>
  <strong>More Visual Studio.</strong> We regularly test our code with Visual
  Studio 2012, 2013, and the CTP builds of 2015. (Earlier versions of Visual
  Studio are no longer supported, since the minimum .NET version required for
  unit test projects is .NET 4.5.)
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Lots of Samples.</strong> Our
  <a href="https://github.com/xunit/samples.xunit">samples</a> project has
  samples ranging from simple assertion enhancement all the way up to
  writing your own replacement unit testing framework.
</p>

<h3>Integrated Theory Support</h3>

<p>
  One of the very first things we did for 2.0 was to remove the
  <code>xunit.extensions</code> project, and integrate the theory support
  directly into xUnit.net core. It did help us to have this as an
  extension when we were driving the v1 design, but we heard from many
  (if not most) of our users that they were all using theories.
</p>
<p>
  The rest of the code in <code>xunit.extensions</code> was moved primarily
  into sample projects. We may ship some of these samples as source-based
  NuGet packages in the near future, based on developer demand.
</p>
<p>
  For more information on migrating v1 tests that use <code>xunit.extensions</code>,
  please see
  <a href="/docs/upgrade-extensions.html">Upgrading xunit.extensions</a>.
</p>

<h3>Parallelism</h3>

<p>
  One of the premiere new features in xUnit.net 2.0 is support for parallelism.
  Back in the old v1 days, people would occasionally hack together MSBuild
  scripts to run multiple assemblies in parallel; this desire to get tests
  running faster drove us to make parallelism a part of the framework itself
  as well as the runners.
</p>
<p>
  The first and most visible part of this decision is the new default behavior
  of xUnit.net to run your tests in parallel. Tests in the same test class
  will not be run in parallel against each other, but tests in different test
  classes will. We call the delineation of tests which can run in parallel
  against each other <em>test collections</em>. In order to prevent tests from
  running in parallel against each other, you put them in the same test
  collection. The default behavior in 2.0 (in the absence of any other
  configuration) is create a test collection for each test class.
</p>
<p>
  This will undoubtedly be the most surprising change for users moving from
  xUnit.net v1 (or other test frameworks). We decided to make this the default
  behavior because we believe that unit tests should be small, self-contained,
  and fast. By running them in parallel, we can better utilize modern computers,
  which typcially have somewhere between 2 and 12 virtual CPUs sitting at the
  ready.
</p>
<p>
  Of course, we provide a way to influence parallelism. For more information
  on how you can tweak these settings, please see
  <a href="/docs/running-tests-in-parallel.html">Running Tests in Parallel</a>.
</p>
<p>
  One of the "victims" of the new parallelism system is that we've removed the
  <code>Timeout</code> property from the <code>[Fact]</code> attribute. In a
  world where many things are running at once, and the system cannot reliably
  determine how much time a given set of code has been running, we needed to
  remove this feature. In addition, if you want test timings to be accurate,
  you will need to turn off all parallelism; otherwise, the test timing numbers
  will be unreliable.
</p>
<p>
  Finally, while xUnit.net 1.x half-heartedly supported asynchronous tests,
  this has been embraced fully by 2.0. This means many of the extensibility
  points in the system are now async, and we have full support for async
  code in the assertion library. You can even decorate your test methods with
  <code>async void</code> instead of <code>async Task</code>, and we'll still
  be able to wait for your tests to finish. (Just to be clear: returning
  <code>Task</code> still works just fine; the <code>async void</code> feature
  is something you can choose to use or not.)
</p>

<h3>Test Collections</h3>

<p>
  We mentioned test collections in the section above on parallelism, but it's
  worth mentioning it separately as a feature, since it has more utility value
  than just setting parallelism boundaries.
</p>
<p>
  The old <code>IUseFixture&lt;T&gt;</code> interface in xUnit.net v1 has been
  replaced by two new interfaces: <code>IClassFixture&lt;T&gt;</code> and
  <code>ICollectionFixture&lt;T&gt;</code>. In addition, the mechanism for
  injecting fixture values into your tests has changed from property setters
  to constructor arguments. Class fixtures are created once and shared amongst
  all tests in the same class (much like the old <code>IUseFixture</code>).
  Collection fixtures work the same way, except that the single instance is
  shared amongst all tests in the same test collection.
</p>
<p>
  For more information on using test collections, please see
  <a href="/docs/shared-context.html">Shared Context between Tests</a>.
</p>

<h3>Test Output</h3>

<p>
  In xUnit.net v1, we captured output written to standard output, standard error,
  the debug channel, and the trace channel, and we surfaced this output up to
  the test runners (which displayed them in a way that was appropriate to the
  test). In addition, the output was placed into the XML output, if you saved
  the result of your test runs.
</p>
<p>
  With xUnit.net v2, we have stopped capturing these sources. The primary reason
  is that these are shared resources, and it's impossible to know which of
  the many unit tests running in parallel might be writing to the console
  or the tracing system. Instead, tests can accept <code>ITestOutputHelper</code>
  as a constructor argument, and use that to provide output that is reported
  up to the runners (and placed into the XML results). It can be used from
  the constructor, from within the test, and from within
  <code>IDisposable.Dispose()</code> (if it's defined).
</p>
<p>
  For more information on using test output, please see the
  <a href="https://github.com/xunit/samples.xunit/blob/main/TestOutputExample">TestOutputExample</a>
  sample project.
</p>

<h3>New Extensibility Model</h3>

<p>
  One of the more common reasons people chose xUnit.net 1.x was because it was
  extremely easy to extend. Those extensibility points offered some measure
  of control over the test framework, but we repeatedly heard from our users
  about use cases they weren't able to accomplish with our extension points.
</p>
<p>
  The re-design of the internal engine of xUnit.net 2.0 was driven primarily
  around our desire to dramatically improve the extensibility of the core
  testing framework itself. We are aware that people write extensions for a
  large number of reasons ranging from simply adding new assertions and
  assert comparers all the way up to writing new test frameworks that can
  leverage the runner infrastructure provided by xUnit.net. We wanted to ensure
  that these users could not only do what they already did, but given them
  many more options for extending xUnit.net.
</p>
<p>
  The <a href="https://github.com/xunit/samples.xunit">Samples</a> project on
  GitHub contains several levels of extensibility samples. Over the next few
  weeks and months, we will be writing documentation (on this site) to go along
  with these samples, to help developers understand how to best exploit the
  power of the new xUnit.net v2 engine.
</p>

<h3>Move to GitHub</h3>

<p>
  xUnit.net got its start not just on CodePlex, but inside of it. Jim and Brad
  developed the early versions of xUnit.net while they were on the CodePlex
  team. Our decision to move from CodePlex wasn't easy, but our community was
  pushing us to make the switch. It was good for us, because we saw an
  immediate and dramatic uptick in community contribution.
</p>
