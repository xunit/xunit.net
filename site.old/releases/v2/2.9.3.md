Today, we're shipping one new release:

* **xUnit.net Core Framework v2 `2.9.3`**

It's been 3 months since the release of [`2.9.2`](2.9.2).

As always, we'd like to thank all the users who contributed to the success of xUnit.net through usage, feedback, and code contributions. ðŸŽ‰

{: .note }
We anticipate this to be the last release of the v2 Core Framework, as all effort is focused on v3 now.

## Release Notes

These release notes are a comprehensive list of changes from `2.9.2` to `2.9.3`.

### Core Framework

* We have removed the flow ID from test collection names in TeamCity messages. [xunit/xunit#3054](https://github.com/xunit/xunit/pull/3054){: .issue-link }

* **BUG:** Fixed an issue with data classes derived from `TheoryData<SomeType[]>` when used via `[ClassData]`. [xunit/xunit#3053](https://github.com/xunit/xunit/issues/3053){: .issue-link }

### Assertion Library

* We have added support for `System.Uri` to `Assert.Equivalent`.

* We have added overloads of `Assert.IsType` and `Assert.IsNotType` which accept a new parameter: `bool exactMatch`. Passing `true` for this value is the same as calling the old overloads; passing `false` for this value is the same as calling `Assert.IsAssignableFrom` or `Assert.IsNotAssignableFrom`. These new overloads attempt to address naming confusing regarding "assignable from", specifically which argument is the "from" and which is the "to". [xunit/xunit#3044](https://github.com/xunit/xunit/issues/3044){: .issue-link }

* **BUG:** Fixed an issue where `Assert.Equivalent` was throwing while trying to compare properties with getters that return ByRefLike types. These properties are now skipped during comparison. [xunit/xunit#3088](https://github.com/xunit/xunit/issues/3088){: .issue-link }
