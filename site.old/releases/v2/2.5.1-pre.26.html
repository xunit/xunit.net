<h2>
  xUnit.net v2 2.5.1 Pre-Release (build 26)
</h2>

<p>
  This is co-released with
  <code>xunit.analyzers</code> version <a href="/releases/analyzers/1.3.0-pre.19"><code>1.3.0-pre.19</code></a> and
  <code>xunit.runner.visualstudio</code> version <a href="/releases/visualstudio/2.5.1-pre.11"><code>2.5.1-pre.11</code></a>.
</p>

<h3>Assertion library</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>BUG:</strong> Fixed an issue with improper disposal of enumerators by <code>CollectionTracker</code>.
    The collection tracker was attempting to use its enumerator after it had been disposed, which manifested
    in this particular case as a stray <code>NullReferenceException</code> with <code>Assert.Single</code>
    using a string of 5 characters of fewer, but in reality caused unexpected behavior depending on the
    specific enumerator implementation. This could impact any assertion that inspected a collection.

  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>BUG:</strong> Fixed an issue where <code>FileInfo</code> and <code>DirectoryInfo</code> were
    causing a stack overflow in <code>Assert.Equivalent</code>, because they create an endless loop of objects
    in their hierarchy (through the <code>Root</code> property of <code>DirectoryInfo</code>). There were
    two fixes added:
    <ol>
      <li>
        We now set a maximum object traversal depth of 50, which is a number much higher than we
        assume anybody would be realistically testing against. If you exceed this, it throws an exception
        which tells you the path it followed to get to level 50, and suggests that you might have an
        infinite loop in your object hierarchy. This should prevent us from crashing with a stack overflow
        if there are any future situations like this (whether they come from built-in types or your own
        custom classes).
      </li>
      <li>
        We special cased <code>FileSystemInfo</code>, the base class for <code>FileInfo</code> and
        <code>DirectoryInfo</code>. When two of these are compared against each other, they only compare
        the value of the <code>FullName</code> property. Analysis shows that every other property is in
        some way derived from the item on disk (whether it's a file or a directory), so comparing the
        full names should be a good test of equivalency.
      </li>
    </ol>
    It's important to note that these fixes only apply to <code>Assert.Equivalent</code>. If you try to
    compare two instances of these classes with <code>Assert.Equal</code>, they will show up as not equal,
    because they are reference types which don't implement any of the equality interfaces in .NET that
    you would normally expect/need when comparing equality.
