<h2>Release Notes</h2>

<p>These release notes are a comprehensive list of changes from 2.6.5 to 2.6.6.</p>

<h3>Core Framework</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    We have back-ported (from v3) support for classes that derive from
    <a href="https://github.com/xunit/xunit/blob/v2/src/xunit.core/Sdk/BeforeAfterTestAttribute.cs"><code>BeforeAfterTestAttribute</code></a>
    to be able to be applied at assembly level (in addition to the current support at method and class
    level). Use the <code>[assembly: MyBeforeAfterTest]</code> syntax to add these, and they will be
    invoked before and after every test in the assembly.

  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Packaging</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    We have fixed the NuGet packages so that we offer additional dependency groups, which should eliminate
    security warnings when using .NET Standard 2.0+, .NET Core 2.0+, and .NET 5+. These were caused by old
    packages from .NET Standard 1.1/.NET Core 1.0 which have been fixed in later platforms.
