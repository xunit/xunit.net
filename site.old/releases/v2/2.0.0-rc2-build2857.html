<h2>xUnit.net v2 2.0 RC 2</h2>

<h3>Core framework</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>BUG:</strong> Times in the XML report weren't written in the invariant culture.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Extensibility</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    Removed all dependencies on .NET serialization, instead standardizing on the
    <code>IXunitSerializable</code> interface. This means anybody implementing
    serialization for test cases no longer has to implement it twice, and can now
    remove the <code>[Serialization]</code> constructor and remove the implementation
    of <code>ISerializable</code>. The new serialization system supports most of the
    built-in intrinsic types (<code>int</code>, <code>long</code>, <code>float</code>,
    <code>double</code>, <code>decimal</code>, <code>string</code>, and their
    nullable counterparts), any type which implements <code>IXunitSerializable</code>,
    and arrays which contain supported serializable types. (Note: the old
    interface <code>IGetTypeData</code> is no longer supported. Extenders should
    implement <code>IXunitSerializable</code> instead.)
  </li>
  <li>
    We added an instance of <code>IMessageSink</code> that is used solely for receiving
    diagnostic messages. Runners can optionally pass this when they create either
    <code>XunitFrontController</code> or <code>Xunit2</code>, and it is propagated
    throughout the system. All extensibility points (implementations of
    <code>IDataDiscoverer</code>, <code>ITestCaseOrderer</code>,
    <code>ITestCollectionOrderer</code>, <code>ITestFrameworkTypeDiscoverer</code>,
    <code>ITraitDiscoverer</code>, <code>IXunitTestCaseDiscoverer</code>,
    <code>IXunitTestCollectionFactory</code>, <code>ITestFramework</code>,
    <code>ITestFrameworkDiscoverer</code>, and <code>ITestFrameworkExecutor</code>)
    can now get access to this message sink by adding <code>IMessageSink</code> as
    a constructor parameter.
  </li>
  <li>
    We removed <code>EnvironmentalWarning</code> and <code>IMessageAggregator</code>.
    Anything which had previously been reporting environmental warnings during discovery
    has now been converted to use the diagnostic message sink described above. In
    addition, several code locations that previously could not log issues (because they
    happened outside of discovery or execution) are now able to report diagnostic
    messages. This should aid developers writing extensibility points because we can
    now report more issues related to creating and using these extensions. (We also
    updated <code>IDiscoveryCompleteMessage</code> to remove the <code>Warnings</code>
    property.)
  </li>
  <li>Exposed <code>XunitTestInvoker.BeforeAfterAttributes</code> to inheritors.</li>
  <li>
    <strong>BUG:</strong> Fixed an issue where assembly-level test collection and
    parallelization configuration options were being ignored.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Console Runner</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Added a <code>-nologo</code> switch to suppress the runner header/copyright.</li>
  <li>Added a <code>-quiet</code> switch to suppress discovery/execution meta-messages.</li>
  <li>Added a <code>-debug</code> switch to launch the debugger on startup.</li>
  <li>
    Diagnostic messages are now being reported to the console as warnings.
    <blockquote>Diagnostic messages are turned off by default. To enable
    diagnostic messages for a given assembly, please see
    <a href="/docs/configuration-files">Configuring xUnit.net</a>.</blockquote>
  <li>
    Skips are written to STDOUT instead of STDERR, as some build systems which monitor STDERR
    to fail a build (which was causing them to fail when skipped tests were present).
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>BUG:</strong> TeamCity v9 was seemingly incorrectly reporting the number of tests,
    because it was combining similar tests together and treating them as multiple invocations
    of the same test.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>MSBuild Runner</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    Diagnostic messages are now being reported to MSBuild as warnings.
    <blockquote>Diagnostic messages are turned off by default. To enable
    diagnostic messages for a given assembly, please see
    <a href="/docs/configuration-files">Configuring xUnit.net</a>.</blockquote>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>BUG:</strong> TeamCity v9 was seemingly incorrectly reporting the number of tests,
    because it was combining similar tests together and treating them as multiple invocations
    of the same test.
  </li>
</ul>


<h2>Visual Studio Runner 2.0 RC2</h2>

<p><em>
  For information on using xUnit.net from within Visual Studio, see
  <a href="/docs/running-tests-in-vs.html">Running xUnit.net tests in Visual
  Studio</a>.
</em></p>

<p>
  <strong>Note:</strong> This release supports all released versions of
  xUnit.net v1, as well as v2 2.0 RC2 or later. It does not support any earlier
  versions of xUnit.net v2.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Diagnostic messages are now being reported to Visual Studio as warnings.
    You can see these messages in the Test pane of the Output window. Note:
    diagnostic messages are only supported during execution for desktop and PCL
    projects (they are not supported for Windows app tests or Windows Phone
    app tests). Diagnostic messages are supported during discovery for all
    platforms, since discovery always happens in the desktop CLR.
    <blockquote>Diagnostic messages are turned off by default. To enable
    diagnostic messages for a given assembly, please see
    <a href="/docs/configuration-files">Configuring xUnit.net</a>.</blockquote>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>BUG:</strong> Runners for Windows 8/8.1 apps and Windows Phone
    8.1 apps were inadvertantly broken (some tests would only run under some
    circumstances).
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>BUG:</strong> Fact methods with parameters were not showing the
    error correctly inside of the Visual Studio runner.
  </li>
</ul>


<h2>ASP.NET 5 Runner 2.0 RC2</h2>

<p><em>
  For information on using xUnit.net from within ASP.NET 5, see
  <a href="/docs/getting-started-aspnet.html">Getting started with xUnit.net and
  ASP.NET 5</a>.
</em></p>

<p>
  <strong>Note:</strong> This release supports xUnit.net v2 2.0 RC2 or later. It does not support
  any earlier versions of xUnit.net v2.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Added a <code>-nologo</code> switch to suppress the runner header/copyright.</li>
  <li>Added a <code>-quiet</code> switch to suppress discovery/execution meta-messages.</li>
  <li>
    Added a <code>-debug</code> switch to launch the debugger on startup. Note that this only
    works with the desktop CLR, as Core CLR does not support <code>Debugger.Launch()</code>.
  </li>
  <li>
    The runner currently supports only console invocation. Support for running tests inside
    of Visual Studio will come in a later release, once the support in ASP.NET has stabilized.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>BUG:</strong> The command line runner was not reporting enough information when
    assembly load failures happened (in particular, compilation errors were not being)
    reported.
  </li>
  <li><strong>BUG:</strong> The <code>-?</code> was being ignored.</li>
</ul>
