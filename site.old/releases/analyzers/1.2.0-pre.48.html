<h1>Release Notes for Analyzers: July 3, 2023</h1>

<h2>xUnit.net Analyzers 1.2.0 Pre-Release (build 48)</h2>

<p>
  This is co-released with the core framework release
  <a href="/releases/v2/2.5.0-pre.44"><code>2.5.0-pre.44</code></a>.
</p>

<p>
  This is the first official release to support the v3 source base. There was some mostly
  coincidental support for v3, but now I've overhauled the tests so that by default, you
  are running your tests against both v2 and v3, and then in certain specific scenarios
  when needed you can run against just one or the other (for example, the xUnit3000 and
  xUnit3001 extensibility analyzers and fixers are only applicable to v2, since they are
  about v2-only types). The failure context now shows what you're running against (v2 or
  v3) when reporting a failure, so it's easier to understand if/when you have issues with
  your tests.
</p>

<p>
  For those who contribute to the source of the analyzers, you'll notice that I did a lot of
  housekeeping on the source base. New and updated base classes for analyzers and fixers have
  been standardized across the board, the source has been cleaned up a bit, and most importantly,
  all fixer tests now require you to pass the fixer key so that only the exact known fixer is
  applied. This was kinda too loosely specified (optional integer indices), and I wanted to
  ensure maximum compatibility (and it should also slightly improve performance because the
  test system knows to only run the singular fixer).
</p>

<h3>Usage Analyzers</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    Updated <a href="/xunit.analyzers/rules/xUnit1010">xUnit1010</a>:
    This was inadvertently triggering when you passed compatible data that had an explicit
    conversion operator (for example, passing a string in the data row, and the argument type
    in the test method supported an explicit conversion from string). This was working at
    runtime but incorrectly triggering in the analyzer.
    <a class="issue-link" href="https://github.com/xunit/xunit/issues/2734">xunit/xunit#2734</a>
  </li>
  <li>
    Updated <a href="/xunit.analyzers/rules/xUnit1019">xUnit1019</a>:
    xUnit.net v3 now supports returning <code>ITheoryDataRow</code> in addition to <code>object[]</code>
    to represent a row of data. This new interface allows you to provide additional metadata along
    with a data row, including a skip message, a custom test display name, a timeout,
    traits, and a flag which indicates whether the data row should only be run when running
    explicit tests. The analyzer needed to be updated to not flag on this data type, when
    used in v3 tests.
    <a class="issue-link" href="https://github.com/xunit/xunit/issues/2735">xunit/xunit#2735</a>
  </li>
  <li>
    Added <a href="/xunit.analyzers/rules/xUnit1028">xUnit1028</a>:
    Test method must have a valid return type. For v2 tests, that means <code>void</code> or
    <code>Task</code>, and for v3 tests you can also return <code>ValueTask</code>. Any other
    return value is invalid. In particular, this should help people who may be accidentally
    returning <code>ValueTask</code> instead of <code>Task</code> for v2 tests, as v2 does
    not support <code>ValueTask</code>.
    <a class="issue-link" href="https://github.com/xunit/xunit/issues/1415">xunit/xunit#1415</a>
    <a class="issue-link" href="https://github.com/xunit/xunit/issues/2733">xunit/xunit#2733</a>
  </li>
  <li>
    Added <a href="/xunit.analyzers/rules/xUnit1029">xUnit1029</a>:
    Disallow xUnit.net attributes on local functions. Attributes on local functions are relatively
    new (introduced in C# 9). Adding the xUnit.net test attributes (like <code>[Fact]</code>) is
    legal in a compiler sense, but we do not discover nor support them. This analyzer should trigger
    on anything derived from <code>FactAttribute</code> or <code>DataAttribute</code>.

  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Assertion Analyzers</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    Updated <a href="/xunit.analyzers/rules/xUnit2013">xUnit2013</a>:
    This analyzer would correctly trigger when using properties like <code>.Count</code> from
    a concrete collection type (f.e., <code>List&lt;int&gt;</code>) but not from an interface
    (f.e., <code>ICollection&lt;int&gt;</code>).
    <a class="issue-link" href="https://github.com/xunit/xunit/issues/2736">xunit/xunit#2736</a>
  </li>
  <li>
    Added <a href="/xunit.analyzers/rules/xUnit2020">xUnit2020</a>:
    When running against v2 2.5+ or v3, you should use <code>Assert.Fail(message)</code>
    rather than <code>Assert.True(false, message)</code> or <code>Assert.False(true, message)</code>.
    For projects targeting older versions of xUnit.net, this analyzer & fixer does not trigger.
    <a class="issue-link" href="https://github.com/xunit/xunit/issues/2521">xunit/xunit#2521</a>
  </li>
</ul>
