<h2>xUnit.net Analyzers 1.4.0 Pre-Release (build 9)</h2>

<p>
  This is co-released with core framework release v2
  <a href="/releases/v2/2.5.2-pre.6"><code>2.5.2-pre.6</code></a>.
</p>

<h3>Usage Analyzers</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    We have updated <a href="/xunit.analyzers/rules/xUnit1030">xUnit1030</a> to not flag any usage of
    <code>.ConfigureAwait(true)</code> so as to not conflict with users who have enabled
    <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/fundamentals/code-analysis/quality-rules/ca2007">CA2007</a>.
    Because <code>.ConfigureAwait(true)</code> is not "free" (and in can break types when used in the context of
    <code>await using</code>), we strongly recommend developers do not enable CA2007 nor call
    <code>.ConfigureAwait(true)</code>.

  </li>
  <li>
    We have updated <a href="/xunit.analyzers/rules/xUnit1031">xUnit1031</a> to cover additional code paths
    which can mark a <code>Task</code> as safe to invoke normally blocking operations (like <code>.Result</code>).
    These include:
    <ul>
      <li>Inside of a <code>.ContinueWith()</code> lambda (for the task parameter in the lambda)</li>
      <li>After using <code>Task.WhenAll</code> (for all tasks in the WhenAll)</li>
      <li>After using <code>Task.WhenAny</code> (for the returned task only)</li>
    </ul>
    In addition, we have lowered the priority of this analyzer to Warning in the case that there are additional
    code paths with "known safe to block" <code>Task</code> objects. We have
    <a href="https://github.com/xunit/xunit/issues/2780#issuecomment-1738284272">commented on the issue</a> with
    several known code paths that we're not currently supporting because of either difficulty to implement and/or
    because of perceived low probability that users will run into it. As such, we've left the issue open for
    further comments if users are seeing these situations (or any others we did not anticipate).

<h3>Extensibility Analyzers</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    We have updated <a href="/xunit.analyzers/rules/xUnit3000">xUnit3000</a> to include all known interfaces
    that might cross <code>AppDomain</code> boundaries. For a complete list of interfaces that are now triggering
    this analyzer, see the linked issue.
