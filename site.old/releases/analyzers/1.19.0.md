Today, we're shipping three new releases:

* xUnit.net Core Framework v3 `1.0.1` ([release notes](/releases/v3/1.0.1))
* **xUnit.net Analyzers `1.19.0`**
* xUnit.net Visual Studio adapter `3.0.1` ([release notes](/releases/visualstudio/3.0.1))

It's been 3Â½ weeks since the release of [`1.18.0` RTM](1.18.0).

As always, we'd like to thank all the users who contributed to the success of xUnit.net through usage, feedback, and code contributions. ðŸŽ‰

## Release Notes

These release notes are a comprehensive list of changes from `1.18.0` to `1.19.0`.

### Usage Analyzers

* **BUG:** Fixed an issue with [xUnit1019](/xunit.analyzers/rules/xUnit1019) which was inappropriately being raised when a data source returned tuples in v3. [xunit/xunit#3102](https://github.com/xunit/xunit/issues/3102){: .issue-link }

* **BUG:** Fixed an issue with [xUnit1051](/xunit.analyzers/rules/xUnit1051) where the analyzer was incorrectly triggering inside of local functions or lambdas in a test method. The most common way this would surface would be when using a lambda-based mocking framework. Note that we have special-cased to keep the analyzer enabled when inside a lambda from `Assert` or `Record`. [xunit/xunit#3087](https://github.com/xunit/xunit/issues/3087){: .issue-link }
