Today, we're shipping one new release and two new prereleases:

* xUnit.net Core Framework v3 `0.3.0-pre.18` ([release notes](/releases/v3/0.3.0-pre.18))
* **xUnit.net Analyzers `1.16.0`**
* xUnit.net Visual Studio adapter `3.0.0-pre.30` ([release notes](/releases/visualstudio/3.0.0-pre.30))

It's been 8 weeks since the release of [`1.15.0` RTM](1.15.0).

As always, we'd like to thank all the users who contributed to the success of xUnit.net through usage, feedback, and code contributions. ðŸŽ‰

## Release Notes

These release notes are a comprehensive list of changes from `1.15.0` to `1.16.0`.

### Usage Analyzers

* **BUG:** We have fixed an issue with [xUnit1012](/xunit.analyzers/rules/xUnit1012) giving a false positive when the signature of the method was a nullable `params` array of a non-nullable type, and the developer passed a single `null` value to `[InlineData]`. The developer's intention here is to pass `null` for the array (which is legal, and works at runtime), but the analyzer was incorrectly flagging this as an incompatible params value. [xunit/xunit#2973](https://github.com/xunit/xunit/issues/2973){: .issue-link }

* **BUG:** We have fixed an issue with [xUnit1012](/xunit.analyzers/rules/xUnit1012) giving a false positive when the user provides compiler-prohibit data values to `[InlineData]` (i.e., `decimal` values). The compiler will still flag the usage with [`CS0182`](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/compiler-messages/parameter-argument-mismatch#arguments-for-attributes) as appropriate. [xunit/xunit#3000](https://github.com/xunit/xunit/issues/3000){: .issue-link }

* **BUG:** We have fixed an issue with [xUnit1039](/xunit.analyzers/rules/xUnit1039) giving a false positive when matching data types against a collection of an open generic type in the test method (i.e., `T[]` or `IEnumerable<T>`). [xunit/xunit#3007](https://github.com/xunit/xunit/issues/3007){: .issue-link }

* We have updated [xUnit1041](/xunit.analyzers/rules/xUnit1041) for v3 users to support the new `[Collection(typeof(T))]` and `[Collection<T>]` attribute overloads.

* We have created [xUnit1051](/xunit.analyzers/rules/xUnit1051) to call out cases in v3 unit tests where the developer could be passing a cancellation token but isn't. The recommended cancellation token is the one from `TestContext.Current.CancellationToken`, though passing any cancellation token will satisfy the analyzer.

  The logic for determining when the user could pass a cancellation token is that either (a) the method they're calling has an optional `CancellationToken` parameter, and they're not passing one, or (b) there is an otherwise identical overload of the method they're calling that includes, as the only extra parameter, a `CancellationToken`. This catches the vast majority of situations, but it is good for developers using v3 to become accustomed to passing the cancellation token whenever possible, including choosing overloads that allow cancellation over ones that don't (even if that means choosing a slightly different overload, like choosing an async variant over a synchronous one).

  We have added a fixer which will either add `TestContext.Current.CancellationToken` or convert explicit usages of `default` or `default(CancellationToken)` into `TestContext.Current.CancellationToken`.

### Assertion Analyzers

* We have created [xUnit2030](/xunit.analyzers/rules/xUnit2030) to suggest that users can convert code like this

  ```csharp
  Assert.NotEmpty(collection.Where(item => /* ... */));
  ```

  to this form, which provides better output when the test fails:

  ```csharp
  Assert.Contains(collection, item => /* ... */);
  ```

* We have added a fixer for [xUnit2031](/xunit.analyzers/rules/xUnit2031) that will convert the LINQ `Where` clause into the two-argument `Assert.Single` call instead.

### Extensibility Analyzers

* We have updated [xUnit3001](/xunit.analyzers/rules/xUnit3001) to verify that any class which is decorated with `[JsonTypeID]` has a parameterless constructor for deserialization purposes.

* We have created [xUnit3002](/xunit.analyzers/rules/xUnit3002) to flag usages of the Core Framework v3 concrete test message types instead of their interface variants.

### Suppressors

* We have added a suppressor for [VSTHRD200](https://github.com/microsoft/vs-threading/blob/main/doc/analyzers/VSTHRD200.md) for test methods, as being forced to add `Async` to their name is not necessary for usability (and impacts their display name).
