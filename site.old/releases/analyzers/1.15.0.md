Today, we're shipping three new releases:

* xUnit.net Core Framework v2 2.9.0 ([release notes](/releases/v2/2.9.0))
* **xUnit.net Analyzers 1.15.0**
* xUnit.net Visual Studio adapter 2.8.2 ([release notes](/releases/visualstudio/2.8.2))

It's been 6 weeks since the release of [1.14.0 RTM](1.14.0).

As always, we'd like to thank all the users who contributed to the success of xUnit.net through usage, feedback, and code contributions. ðŸŽ‰

## Release Notes

These release notes are a comprehensive list of changes from 1.14.0 to 1.15.0.

### General

* Support for v3 Core Framework test projects has been upgraded to support 0.2.0 and later. Because of the sweeping name & namespace changes that occurred with 0.2.0, you may find false positives when using the analyzers with projects that are still targeting 0.1.1. It's strongly recommended that you upgrade to v3 Core Framework 0.2.0 as soon as possible.

* We fixed an issue with the way the analyzer NuGet package was being made that was causing a CompilerServer failure for some users (which increased build times in addition to the reported non-fatal error). [xunit/xunit#2943](https://github.com/xunit/xunit/issues/2943){: .issue-link }

### Assertion Analyzers

* We have created [xUnit2029](/xunit.analyzers/rules/xUnit2029) to suggest that users can convert code like this

  ```csharp
  Assert.Empty(collection.Where(item => /* ... */));
  ```

  to this form, which provides better output when the test fails:

  ```csharp
  Assert.DoesNotContain(collection, item => /* ... */);
  ```

### Extensibility Analyzers

* We have updated [xUnit3001](/xunit.analyzers/rules/xUnit3001) to add support for v3 classes which implement `IXunitSerializable`.
