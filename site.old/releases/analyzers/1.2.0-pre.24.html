<h1>Release Notes for Analyzers: June 14, 2023</h1>

<a href="https://www.dotnetfoundation.org/"><img align="right" src="/images/dotnet-fdn-logo.png" width="100" /></a>

<h2>xUnit.net Analyzers 1.2.0 Pre-Release (build 24)</h2>

<p>
  This is co-released with the core framework release
  <a href="/releases/v2/2.5.0-pre.26"><code>2.5.0-pre.26</code></a>.
</p>

<p class="note">
  This version has updated the minimum supported Visual Studio to 2022. It is possible that the analyzers
  will continue to work with older versions of Visual Studio, but we do not guarantee or test against that.
</p>

<h3>Usage Analyzers</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    Updated xUnit1026 to ignore unused parameters when the name matches the discard logic specified by
    <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/fundamentals/code-analysis/style-rules/ide0060">IDE0060</a>.
    That includes parameters named simply <code>_</code> as well parameters named starting with an
    underscore followed by a integer number (e.g., <code>_123</code>).
    <a class="issue-link" href="https://github.com/xunit/xunit/issues/2730">xunit/xunit#2730</a>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>BUG:</strong> Fixed an issue in the xUnit1033 fixer ("Generate constructor") where the generated
    constructor should've been public, but wasn't.
    <a class="issue-link" href="https://github.com/xunit/xunit/issues/2721">xunit/xunit#2721</a>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Assertion Analyzers</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    Updated xUnit2018 to include support for the new <code>Assert.IsNotAssignableFrom</code> assertion.
    This includes an updated message in the analyzer, and updated code generation for the fixer.
    <a class="issue-link" href="https://github.com/xunit/xunit/issues/2727">xunit/xunit#2727</a>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>BUG:</strong> Fixed an issue with common code for xUnit1010 and xUnit1012 that was causing an
    exception in the analyzer when the user was passing an explicit empty array to provide values for
    a <code>params</code>-style array in the test method. A secondary issue (for non-empty explicit
    arrays) was also discovered and fixed at the same time.
    <a class="issue-link" href="https://github.com/xunit/xunit/issues/2711">xunit/xunit#2711</a>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Miscellany</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    The included <code>install.ps1</code> and <code>uninstall.ps1</code> files are now the signed
    versions provided by Microsoft.
  </li>
  <li>
    We have updated to version <code>4.6.0</code> of <code>Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.CSharp</code> and
    <code>Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.CSharp.Workspaces</code>. In addition to bringing us up to date with
    latest language features, this also gives us better coverage when your tests are being compiled
    with the <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/nullable-references">Nullable
    Reference Types</a> feature enabled. This should allow us to enable future analyzers based
    on newer C# language features, and should also help our analyzers be more robust (as the
    libraries we're consuming now themselves are enabled for Nullable Reference Types).
  </li>
</ul>
