Today, we're shipping one new release and two new prereleases:

* xUnit.net Core Framework v3 `0.6.0-pre.7` ([release notes](/releases/v3/0.6.0-pre.7))
* **xUnit.net Analyzers `1.17.0`**
* xUnit.net Visual Studio adapter `3.0.0-pre.49` ([release notes](/releases/visualstudio/3.0.0-pre.49))

It's been 10 weeks since the release of [`1.16.0` RTM](1.16.0).

As always, we'd like to thank all the users who contributed to the success of xUnit.net through usage, feedback, and code contributions. ðŸŽ‰

## Release Notes

These release notes are a comprehensive list of changes from `1.16.0` to `1.17.0`.

### Usage Analyzers

* We have updated [xUnit1010](/xunit.analyzers/rules/xUnit1010) to trigger if your `InlineData` value is a negative integral value, but the theory parameter is an unsigned integral type. [xunit/xunit.analyzers#189](https://github.com/xunit/xunit.analyzers/pull/189){: .issue-link }

* We have updated [xUnit1045](/xunit.analyzers/rules/xUnit1045) and [xUnit1047](/xunit.analyzers/rules/xUnit1047) to take usage of `[assembly: RegisterXunitSerializer]` into account when determining what constitutes a serializable value.

* **BUG:** Fixed an issue with [xUnit1051](/xunit.analyzers/rules/xUnit1051) where the fixer was being applied twice in some situations. [xunit/xunit.analyzers#190](https://github.com/xunit/xunit.analyzers/pull/190){: .issue-link }

### Assertion Analyzers

* We have created [xUnit2032](/xunit.analyzers/rules/xUnit2032) to soft-deprecate `Assert.IsAssignableFrom` and `Assert.IsNotAssignableFrom` since the names are confusing (based on which of the arguments is the "from" vs. the "to"). Instead, we have created new overloads of `Assert.IsType` and `Assert.IsNotType` that accept a new parameter: `bool exactMatch`. Passing `true` for this gives the same behavior as using the older overloads; passing `false` for this gives the same behavior as calling `Assert.IsAssignableFrom` or `Assert.IsNotAssignableFrom`. A fixer was added which can convert your "assignable from" calls into "is type" calls with the appropriate flag.

* We have updated [xUnit2018](/xunit.analyzers/rules/xUnit2018) to not trigger when using the new overloads of `Assert.IsType` or `Assert.IsNotType` which allow you pass an `exactMatch` flag (unless you pass `true` for the flag, which is identical to the behavior without the flag, and therefore should be triggered). We have updated the fixer so that it will pass `exactMatch: false` rather than switch you to `Assert.IsAssignableFrom` or `Assert.IsNotAssignableFrom`, assuming you're using a version of xUnit.net's assertion library that has the new overload.

### Extensibility Analyzers

* We have updated [xUnit3001](/xunit.analyzers/rules/xUnit3001) to trigger for `IRunnerReporter` (v3 only) and `IXunitSerializer` since they both require a parameterless public constructor so that they can be created by the framework. Unlike in other cases, when this constructor is being generated by the fixer, it is not marked as `[Obsolete]`, since it's not used for deserialization; that remains only in place for serializable objects (things that implement `IXunitSerializable` or are decorated with `[JsonTypeID]`.
