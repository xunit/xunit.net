Today, we're shipping three new releases:

* **xUnit.net Core Framework v3 `1.0.1`**
* xUnit.net Analyzers `1.19.0`([release notes](/releases/analyzers/1.19.0))
* xUnit.net Visual Studio adapter `3.0.1` ([release notes](/releases/visualstudio/3.0.1))

It's been 3Â½ weeks since the release of [`1.0.0` RTM](1.0.0).

As always, we'd like to thank all the users who contributed to the success of xUnit.net through usage, feedback, and code contributions. ðŸŽ‰

## Release Notes

These release notes are a list of changes from `1.0.0` to `1.0.1`.

### Core Framework

* We have added support for writing unit tests as default interface methods (introduced in C# 8). Any test class which implements an interface with default interface methods, those test methods will be discovered as part of the test class. [xunit/xunit#1945](https://github.com/xunit/xunit/issues/1945){: .issue-link }

* **BUG:** We fixed a problem when running v3 test assemblies with unlimited parallel threads specified. [xunit/visualstudio.xunit#432](https://github.com/xunit/visualstudio.xunit/issues/432){: .issue-link }

### Assertion Library

* **BUG:** Fixed an issue where `Assert.Equivalent` was throwing while trying to compare properties with getters that return ByRefLike types. These properties are now skipped during comparison. [xunit/xunit#3088](https://github.com/xunit/xunit/issues/3088){: .issue-link }

### Runner Utility and Runners

* We have added `ConfigReader_Json.LoadFromJson` which allows the developer to pass the JSON as a string. This differs from `Load` which reads the JSON from a file on the filesystem. [xunit/xunit#3117](https://github.com/xunit/xunit/issues/3117){: .issue-link }

* **BUG:** We fixed an issue where ANSI color codes reported into test output were causing issues with reports. The most common way you might encounter this is using `[assembly: CaptureConsole]` while writing ANSI color codes to the standard output. [xunit/xunit#3091](https://github.com/xunit/xunit/issues/3091){: .issue-link }

### Project Templates

* **BUG:** We fixed an issue with the `xunit3-extension` new project template. The sample code would not compile as-is.

### NuGet Packages

* When viewing our NuGet packages on NuGet.org, they previously just showed the standard project README. Now they will also display the package name and description, which often contains valuable information for the developer (like which target frameworks are supported). [xunit/xunit#3115](https://github.com/xunit/xunit/issues/3115){: .issue-link }

* **BUG:** We have fixed an issue that was causing the NuGet packages to report that the binaries weren't deterministic. [xunit/xunit#3108](https://github.com/xunit/xunit/issues/3108){: .issue-link }
