Today, we're shipping one new release and two new prereleases:

* **xUnit.net Core Framework v3 `0.6.0-pre.7`**
* xUnit.net Analyzers `1.17.0` ([release notes](/releases/analyzers/1.17.0))
* xUnit.net Visual Studio adapter `3.0.0-pre.49` ([release notes](/releases/visualstudio/3.0.0-pre.49))

It's been 3 weeks since the release of [`0.5.0-pre.27`](0.5.0-pre.27).

As always, we'd like to thank all the users who contributed to the success of xUnit.net through usage, feedback, and code contributions. ðŸŽ‰

## If you are new to v3

We have created two new pieces of documentation that we will continue to evolve as we create newer prerelease versions of xUnit.net v3:

* [Migrating from xUnit.net v2 to v3](/docs/getting-started/v3/migration)
* [What's New in xUnit.net v3](/docs/getting-started/v3/whats-new)

We recommend you read them in that order. The migration guide will help you understand what changes are necessary to get your v2 test project ready to upgrade to v3, and it includes a fairly comprehensive list of the changes (and hopefully relatively small bumps in the road) that you can expect. This latter part is provided primarily in resource form, so rather than reading the giant boring lists, you can do a search on the page when you encounter issues with specific types. Once you've got your project ported over to v3, the what's new guide will be useful to understand what new features are available to you with v3.

Please note that you will need to use a version `3.x.y` release of the Visual Studio adapter to run v3 tests, as the `2.x.y` releases are only capable of running v1 and v2 tests. We will eventually stop shipping the `2.x.y` builds, as the `3.x.y` builds are also capable of running v1 and v2 tests. We'd love if users test the `3.x.y` release of the Visual Studio adapter even if they cannot migrate to the v3 Core Framework.

## Release Notes

These release notes are a list of changes from `0.5.0-pre.27` to `0.6.0-pre.7`.

### Core Framework

* We have introduced a new base class (`TheoryDataRowBase`) that `TheoryDataRow` and all the generic versions of `TheoryDataRow<>` derive from. Previously, the generic versions derived from the non-generic `TheoryDataRow`, but this is no longer the case (so this is a breaking change from an inheritance/identity perspective).

* We have updated the generic versions of `TheoryData<>`, `TheoryDataRow<>`, and `MatrixTheoryData<>` to now accept up to 15 parameters. [xunit/xunit#3049](https://github.com/xunit/xunit/issues/3049){: .issue-link }

* **BUG:** We have fixed an issue with theory data serialization where arrays of enums or arrays of types implementing `IXunitSerializable` were coming back as the wrong array type, causing a catastrophic failure when trying to run the tests in Test Explorer. [xunit/xunit#3051](https://github.com/xunit/xunit/issues/3051){: .issue-link }

### Assertion Library

* We have added overloads of `Assert.IsType` and `Assert.IsNotType` which accept a new parameter: `bool exactMatch`. Passing `true` for this value is the same as calling the old overloads; passing `false` for this value is the same as calling `Assert.IsAssignableFrom` or `Assert.IsNotAssignableFrom`. These new overloads attempt to address naming confusing regarding "assignable from", specifically which argument is the "from" and which is the "to".
