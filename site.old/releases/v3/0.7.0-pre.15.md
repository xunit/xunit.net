Today, we're shipping one new prerelease:

* **xUnit.net Core Framework v3 `0.7.0-pre.15`**

It's been 3 weeks since the release of [`0.6.0-pre.7`](0.6.0-pre.7).

As always, we'd like to thank all the users who contributed to the success of xUnit.net through usage, feedback, and code contributions. ðŸŽ‰

**Note:** Anybody who clones the source for the core project will note that we are now sticking to .NET 8 SDK with `global.json`. Please make sure you have .NET 8 SDK installed to build the source.

## If you are new to v3

We have created two new pieces of documentation that we will continue to evolve as we create newer prerelease versions of xUnit.net v3:

* [Migrating from xUnit.net v2 to v3](/docs/getting-started/v3/migration)
* [What's New in xUnit.net v3](/docs/getting-started/v3/whats-new)

We recommend you read them in that order. The migration guide will help you understand what changes are necessary to get your v2 test project ready to upgrade to v3, and it includes a fairly comprehensive list of the changes (and hopefully relatively small bumps in the road) that you can expect. This latter part is provided primarily in resource form, so rather than reading the giant boring lists, you can do a search on the page when you encounter issues with specific types. Once you've got your project ported over to v3, the what's new guide will be useful to understand what new features are available to you with v3.

Please note that you will need to use a version `3.x.y` release of the Visual Studio adapter to run v3 tests, as the `2.x.y` releases are only capable of running v1 and v2 tests. We will eventually stop shipping the `2.x.y` builds, as the `3.x.y` builds are also capable of running v1 and v2 tests. We'd love if users test the `3.x.y` release of the Visual Studio adapter even if they cannot migrate to the v3 Core Framework.

## Release Notes

These release notes are a list of changes from `0.6.0-pre.7` to `0.7.0-pre.15`.

### Core Framework

* Fixtures can now be retrieved via `TestContext.Current.GetFixture()`. This makes it easier for developers who create base test classes to avoid using constructor injection (which forces derived classes to implement the constructors) and instead retrieve fixture instances on-demand. [xunit/xunit#3056](https://github.com/xunit/xunit/issues/3056){: .issue-link }

* We have updated the XML documentation for places where `nameof()` is recommended (this includes `FactAttribute.SkipWhen`, `FactAttribute.SkipUnless`, and the `MemberData.memberName` constructor parameter). [xunit/xunit#3062](https://github.com/xunit/xunit/issues/3062){: .issue-link }

* We have reverted `BeforeAfterTestAttributes`'s `Before` and `After` methods to return `void` rather than `ValueTask`, as some of the extensibility that used to be achievable here was no longer possible, due to the async machinery that would prevent values from propagating out of an `async` method (for example, setting thread-local values).

* We have added `Xunit.v3.DynamicSkipToken.Value` to `xunit.v3.core` to provide a standardized way to access the token value (`$XunitDynamicSkip$`) that should start exception messages to indicate when the exception indicates that the test should be skipped, rather than failed.

* **BUG:** The XML report was inappropriately escaping CRLF characters in skip reasons and exception messages. These are now properly preserved in the output.

* **BUG:** The `xunit.v3.core` NuGet package was constructed in such a way that F12 into the SourceLink'd source code was broken. Fixing this required removing our reference libraries, which were used to hide an attribute that's not supported on .NET Framework (`CollectionAttribute<T>`). We have updated the XML documentation for this attribute to note that this is not supported on .NET Framework, even though it's now available for consumption. Unfortunately, the failure is surfaced at runtime, not compile time (owing to the fact that .NET Framework cannot instantiate generic attributes).

### Extensibility

* We have removed default self-execution from `IXunitTestCase` because it complicated extensibility by forcing developers to create new test case objects (and replace the discoverers) in order to customize execution. This involved:

  * Removing `IXunitTestCase.Run`
  * Adding `IXunitTestCase.PreInvoke` and `IXunitTestCase.PostInvoke` to easily allow before and after operations
  * Creating `ISelfExecutingXunitTestCase`, with the `Run` method moved here, so we could still allow developers to create their own self-executing test cases without having to override most of the execution pipeline.

  The [samples project](https://github.com/xunit/samples.xunit) includes samples that utilize these new extensibility points:

  * The [RetryTestCase](https://github.com/xunit/samples.xunit/blob/8771df9c6959378f8516201c6eac63a0d180dbb0/v3/RetryFactExample/Extensions/RetryTestCase.cs) in the `RetryFactExample` shows using `ISelfExecutingXunitTestCase` to customize the execution to allow the test case to be run multiple times until it hits a maximum count or until the test passes
  * The [NamespaceParallelization](https://github.com/xunit/samples.xunit/tree/8771df9c6959378f8516201c6eac63a0d180dbb0/v3/NamespaceParallelization) sample is able to override test case execution without using a custom test case

* We have restructured the runner classes to introduce base classes with a customizable context as needed, as well as moving more functionality from the XunitXyzRunner classes into the base XyzRunner classes. We have also collapsed three classes (test case runner, test runner, and test invoker) into two, removing the old invoker classes. This includes:

  * `TestAssemblyRunner`
    * Added helper/extensibility point `FailTestCollection` (fails the test cases for the given collection)
    * Implements `OnTestAssemblyCleanupFailure` (sending `TestAssemblyCleanupFailure`)
    * Implements `OnTestAssemblyFinished` (sending `TestAssemblyFinished`)
    * Implements `OnTestAssemblyStarting` (sending `TestAssemblyStarting`)
  * `XunitTestAssemblyRunnerBase`
    * Contains most of the original implementation code from `XunitTestAssemblyRunner`, with a customizable context
  * `TestCollectionRunner`
    * Added helper/extensibility point `FailTestClass` (fails the test cases for the given class)
    * Implements `OnTestCollectionCleanupFailure` (sending `TestCollectionCleanupFailure`)
    * Implements `OnTestCollectionFinished` (sending `TestCollectionFinished`)
    * Implements `OnTestCollectionStarting` (sending `TestCollectionStarting`)
  * `XunitTestCollectionRunnerBase`
    * Contains most of the original implementation code from `XunitTestCollectionRunner`, with a customizable context
  * `TestClassRunner`
    * Added helper/extensibility point `FailTestMethod` (fails the test cases for the given method)
    * Implements `OnTestClassCleanupFailure` (sending `TestClassCleanupFailure`)
    * Implements `OnTestClassFinished` (sending `TestClassFinished`)
    * Implements `OnTestClassStarting` (sending `TestClassStarting`)
  * `XunitTestClassRunnerBase`
    * Contains most of the original implementation code from `XunitTestClassRunner`, with a customizable context
  * `TestMethodRunner`
    * Added helper/extensibility point `FailTestCase` (fails the given test case)
    * Implements `OnTestMethodCleanupFailure` (sending `TestMethodCleanupFailure`)
    * Implements `OnTestMethodFinished` (sending `TestMethodFinished`)
    * Implements `OnTestMethodStarting` (sending `TestMethodStarting`)
  * `XunitTestMethodRunnerBase`
    * Contains most of the original implementation code from `XunitTestMethodRunner`, with a customizable context
  * `TestCaseRunnerBase`
    * Implements `OnTestMethodCleanupFailure` (sending `TestMethodCleanupFailure`)
    * Implements `OnTestMethodFinished` (sending `TestMethodFinished`)
    * Implements `OnTestMethodStarting` (sending `TestMethodStarting`)
  * `TestCaseRunner`
    * Added helper/extensibility point `FailTest` (fails the given test)
  * `XunitTestCaseRunnerBase`
    * Contains most of the original implementation code from `XunitCaseMethodRunner`, with a customizable context
  * `TestRunnerBase`
    * Implements `OnTestCleanupFailure` (sending `TestCleanupFailure`)
    * Implements `OnTestFailed` (sending `TestFailed`)
    * Implements `OnTestFinished` (sending `TestFinished`)
    * Implements `OnTestNotRun` (sending `TestNotRun`)
    * Implements `OnTestPassed` (sending `TestPassed`)
    * Implements `OnTestSkipped` (sending `TestSkipped`)
    * Implements `OnTestStarting` (sending `TestStarting`)
    * Adds an overload of `OnTestStarting` to support explicit and timeout values
    * Adds `UpdateTestContext` to allow the test class instance and test state to be updated without destroying the existing context
  * `TestRunner`
    * Implements `DisposeTestClassInstance` (supporting `IDisposable` and `IAsyncDisposable`)
    * Added helper/extensibility point `InvokeTest` (running the test method via reflection)
    * Implements `IsTestClassDisposable` (looking for `IDisposable` and `IAsyncDisposable`)
    * Implements `OnTestClassConstructionFinished` (sending `TestClassConstructionFinished`)
    * Implements `OnTestClassConstructionStarting` (sending `TestClassConstructionStarting`)
    * Implements `OnTestClassDisposeFinished` (sending `TestClassDisposeFinished`)
    * Implements `OnTestClassDisposeStarting` (sending `TestClassDisposeStarting`)
    * Now responsible for creating, initializing, and disposing `TestOutputHelper` (during `OnTestStarting` and `OnTestFinished`)
  * `XunitTestRunnerBase`
    * Contains most of the original implementation code from `XunitTestRunner`, with a customizable context

* We have updated `XunitRunnerHelper` to work against `ITestCase` instead of requiring `IXunitTestCase`, and added a new helper method to run any `IXunitTestCase` (to replace the old default implementation of  `XunitTestCase.Run`).

* We have updated `TestCaseDiscoverer` to allow discoverers to return any `ITestCase` implementation, rather than being stuck to a more derived implementation. This more easily allows the creation of composite test frameworks which are able to return and run test cases that implement various interfaces (for example, implementing most of the discovered test cases with a new custom type, while utilizing test cases from outside that class hierarchy, like `ExecutionErrorTestCase`).

* **BUG:** It was discovered that test case objects (namely, anything which implements `ITestCase`) were not getting disposed when they should have. The contract for `ITestCase` does not include `IDisposable` or `IAsyncDisposable` by default, but the intention was that we would support it if you added it. This has been fixed.
