Today we're shipping the first prerelease version of xUnit.net v3!

This takes the form of three preleases:

* **xUnit.net Core Framework v3 `0.2.0-pre.69`**
* xUnit.net Analyzers `1.16.0-pre.22` ([release notes](/releases/analyzers/1.16.0-pre.22))
* xUnit.net Visual Studio adapter `3.0.0-pre.20` ([release notes](/releases/visualstudio/3.0.0-pre.20))

This has been a long time coming, and we're excited to show you what we've been spending our time on. We have created two new pieces of documentation that we will continue to evolve as we create newer prerelease versions of xUnit.net v3:

* [Migrating from xUnit.net v2 to v3](/docs/getting-started/v3/migration)
* [What's New in xUnit.net v3](/docs/getting-started/v3/whats-new)

We recommend you read them in that order. The migration guide will help you understand what changes are necessary to get your v2 test project ready to upgrade to v3, and it includes a fairly comprehensive list of the changes (and hopefully relatively small bumps in the road) that you can expect. This latter part is provided primarily in resource form, so rather than reading the giant boring lists, you can do a search on the page when you encounter issues with specific types. Once you've got your project ported over to v3, the what's new guide will be useful to understand what new features are available to you with v3.

Please note that you will need to use a version `3.x.y` release of the Visual Studio adapter to run v3 tests, as the `2.x.y` releases are only capable of running v1 and v2 tests. We will eventually stop shipping the `2.x.y` builds, as the `3.x.y` builds are also capable of running v1 and v2 tests. We'd love if users test the `3.x.y` release of the Visual Studio adapter even if they cannot migrate to the v3 Core Framework.

As always, we'd like to thank all the users who contributed to the success of xUnit.net through usage, feedback, and code contributions. ðŸŽ‰
