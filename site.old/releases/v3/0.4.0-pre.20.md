Today, we're shipping one new release and two new prereleases:

* xUnit.net Core Framework v2 `2.9.1` ([release notes](/releases/v2/2.9.1))
* **xUnit.net Core Framework v3 `0.4.0-pre.20`**
* xUnit.net Visual Studio adapter `3.0.0-pre.35` ([release notes](/releases/visualstudio/3.0.0-pre.35))

It's been 3 weeks since the release of [`0.3.0-pre.18`](0.3.0-pre.18).

As always, we'd like to thank all the users who contributed to the success of xUnit.net through usage, feedback, and code contributions. ðŸŽ‰

## If you are new to v3

We have created two new pieces of documentation that we will continue to evolve as we create newer prerelease versions of xUnit.net v3:

* [Migrating from xUnit.net v2 to v3](/docs/getting-started/v3/migration)
* [What's New in xUnit.net v3](/docs/getting-started/v3/whats-new)

We recommend you read them in that order. The migration guide will help you understand what changes are necessary to get your v2 test project ready to upgrade to v3, and it includes a fairly comprehensive list of the changes (and hopefully relatively small bumps in the road) that you can expect. This latter part is provided primarily in resource form, so rather than reading the giant boring lists, you can do a search on the page when you encounter issues with specific types. Once you've got your project ported over to v3, the what's new guide will be useful to understand what new features are available to you with v3.

Please note that you will need to use a version `3.x.y` release of the Visual Studio adapter to run v3 tests, as the `2.x.y` releases are only capable of running v1 and v2 tests. We will eventually stop shipping the `2.x.y` builds, as the `3.x.y` builds are also capable of running v1 and v2 tests. We'd love if users test the `3.x.y` release of the Visual Studio adapter even if they cannot migrate to the v3 Core Framework.

## Release Notes

These release notes are a list of changes from `0.3.0-pre.18` to `0.4.0-pre.20`.

### Core Framework

* We have added support for Microsoft Testing Platform natively to all v3 test projects. This enables a new `dotnet test` and Test Explorer experience (both of which are currently experimental), as well as an alternative command line UX (you can toggle between xUnit.net's native command line vs. Microsoft Testing Platform's command line at compile time with an MSBuild property). For more information, see [Microsoft Testing Platform support in xUnit.net v3](/docs/getting-started/v3/microsoft-testing-platform).

* We have updated `ITestOutputHelper` to include `Write` methods, in addition to `WriteLine` methods. (Note that output will still be buffered per line, so live output will still be reported on a per-line basis, not on a per `Write` basis. Lines are demarcated by `Environment.NewLine`, so if writing newlines manually, make sure you use this runtime value and don't hardcore `\r\n` or `\n`, if your tests run on multiple OSes.)

* We have added two new assembly-level attributes (`[CaptureConsole]` and `[CaptureTrace]`) which will capture `Console` output and `Trace`/`Debug` output, respectively. Output to these sources will show up in the standard output, as though it had been written to `ITestOutputHelper`. [xunit/xunit#1730](https://github.com/xunit/xunit/issues/1730){: .issue-link }

* We have added support for `Timeout` on tests which are not async; previously, `Timeout` only worked for tests that were async test methods. (Note that the effectiveness of using `Timeout` with parallelization enabled requires that you use the [`conservative` parallelization algorithm](/docs/configuration-files#parallelAlgorithm)). [xunit/xunit#2222](https://github.com/xunit/xunit/issues/2222){: .issue-link }

* The `TestContext` class now implements `ITestContext`, and `ITestContextAccessor.Current` returns `ITestContext`.

* We have added a `TestMethodArguments` property to `IXunitTest`. Extensions may retrieve the test method arguments for the currently executing test by inspecting `TestContext.Current.Test`, and testing to see that it implements `IXunitTest` (the built-in test framework will always do so). (Note for extensibility authors, this used to be present on `XunitTestRunnerContext`, and plumbing through these values changed the signatures of several of the base interfaces and context classes; these breaking changes are what necessitated the bump to `0.4.0`.) [xunit/xunit#3020](https://github.com/xunit/xunit/issues/3020){: .issue-link }

* We have updated the xUnit.net XML report (and bumped the schema version to `3`) to add [`start-rtf` and `finish-rtf` properties to `<test>`](/docs/format-xml-v2#test) nodes.

* We have updated the TRX report to add `startTime` and `endTime` properties nodes to `<UnitTestResult>` nodes. We have also added several new nodes to the report to track the TRX report that is generated by Microsoft Testing Platform.

* **BUG:** We fixed an issue where sometimes conditionally skipped theories would not be properly skipped (when pre-enumeration was disabled). (Note for extensibility authors, this required a constructor signature change to `XunitDelayEnumeratedTheoryTestCase` to pass along the conditional skip values from the `[Theory]` attribute.)

* **BUG:** We fixed an issue with the TRX report that was mistakenly categorizing 'not run' tests (usually `Explicit = true` tests which weren't run) as `notExecuted`. They are now correctly categorized as `notRunnable`.

### Assertion Library

* We have added support for `Guid` values to `Assert.Equivalent`. [xunit/xunit#2974](https://github.com/xunit/xunit/issues/2974){: .issue-link }

* We have added support for `Lazy<T>` values to `Assert.Equivalent`. When encountered anywhere in the expected and/or actual side of the comparison, the underlying value will be compared.

* We have added support for `IEnumerable<IGrouping<TKey, TValue>>` to `Assert.Equivalent`. We have also added support for this to `ArgumentFormatter`, which should allow properly displaying groupings rather than falling back to the triple-ellipses display. (Note: Using `Assert.Equal` with groupings will cause false positives due of the fact `IGrouping<>` implements `IEnumerable<TValue>`, so the containers only compare values and not keys. Only `Assert.Equivalent` is supported for comparing two groupings.) [xunit/xunit#3028](https://github.com/xunit/xunit/issues/3028){: .issue-link }

* **BUG:** We have fixed an issue with compiler ambiguity related to arrays and spans (for .NET 6+ users) by adding an additional overload (`Equal<T>(ReadOnlySpan<T>, T[]`). [xunit/xunit#3021](https://github.com/xunit/xunit/issues/3021){: .issue-link }

### Runners

* We have added the ability to use a [query filter language](/docs/query-filter-language) to filter tests.

   * For xUnit.net native command lines and `xunit.v3.runner.console`, specify a query filter using `-filter <expression>`
   * For Microsoft Testing Platform command lines, specify a query filter using `--query-filter <expression>`

   You can use either query filtering or the existing simple filtering, but you cannot mix both together at the same time. Note that query filters specified to `xunit.v3.runner.console` can also be used for v1 and v2 tests (in addition to v3 tests). [xunit/xunit#1833](https://github.com/xunit/xunit/issues/1833){: .issue-link }

### Extensibility

* We have added the `TestClassSimpleName` property to `ITestCaseMetadata` and `ITestClassMetadata`. This will be set to the class name without the namespace, but include the nested class hierarchy (i.e., if `TestClassName` is `Foo.Bar.Baz+Biff` and `TestClassNamespace` is `Foo.Bar`, then `TestClassSimpleName` will be `Baz+Biff`).


## Runner support for Core Framework v3

### Supported by the xUnit.net team

Functional:

_Support for `dotnet test`, Visual Studio, and Visual Studio Code comes from the Visual Studio runner (a `3.x.y` build of `xunit.runner.visualstudio`)._
