## Release Notes

These release notes are a list of changes from `3.0.0-pre.20` to `3.0.0-pre.24`.

### Features and Fixes

* **BUG:** We have fixed an issue where `xunit.runner.visualstudio` would not run tests on Linux or macOS when using Mono (for .NET Framework projects). This manifested as a warning message reading: `No test is available in /path/to/tests.exe. Make sure that test discoverer & executors are registered and platform & framework version settings are appropriate and try again.`  [xunit/visualstudio.xunit#411](https://github.com/xunit/visualstudio.xunit/issues/411){: .issue-link }

* For developers contributing to `xunit.runner.visualstudio`, you can now build and run tests for the project on Linux and macOS.
