<h2>Release Notes</h2>

<p>These release notes are a comprehensive list of changes from 2.5.5 to 2.5.6.</p>

<h3>Features and Fixes</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>BUG:</strong> Fixed a race condition introduced by <code>ExecutionSink</code> in
    core framework v2 2.6.3 which was causing runners to sometimes trigger an
    <code>ObjectDisposedException</code> while finishing running an assembly. This was more
    easily reproduced in low CPU thread count conditions (more common in CI environments than
    developer machines). This runner build includes that fix.

  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>BUG:</strong> Fixed an issue where Visual Studio Test Explorer would output a message
    stating <code>Failed to load extensions from file 'xunit.runner.visualstudio.dotnetcore.testadapter.dll'</code>
    when discovering or running tests for .NET Framework. (The message was benign, so the only change here is
    that the message is no longer being generated.)
