Today, we're shipping three new releases:

* xUnit.net Core Framework v2 2.9.0 ([release notes](/releases/v2/2.9.0))
* xUnit.net Analyzers 1.15.0 ([release notes](/releases/analyzers/1.15.0))
* **xUnit.net Visual Studio adapter 2.8.2**

It's been 6 weeks since the release of [2.8.1 RTM](2.8.1).

As always, we'd like to thank all the users who contributed to the success of xUnit.net through usage, feedback, and code contributions. ðŸŽ‰

## Release Notes

This is a maintenance release and offers no new features.

## Support for v3 Core Framework

We have started releasing [CI builds](/docs/using-ci-builds) with `3.0.0-pre` version numbers that are capable of running tests from
all of v1, v2, and v3 Core Framework. The current release (`3.0.0-pre.11`) is designed to run v3 Core Framework tests from builds
`0.2.0` and later (it will not run tests written against `0.1.1` pre-release builds).

Stay tuned as we will have more to say about this when we ship the first v3 Core Framework pre-release soon!
