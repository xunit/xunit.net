<h1>Release Notes: July 3, 2023</h1>

<h2>
  xunit.runner.visualstudio 2.5.0 Pre-Release (build 27)
</h2>

<p>
  This is co-released with the core framework release
  <a href="/releases/v2/2.5.0-pre.44"><code>2.5.0-pre.44</code></a>.
</p>

<h3>Features and Fixes</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    Added support for <a href="/docs/configuration-files#stopOnFail"><code>stopOnFail</code></a> configuration file
    element.
  </li>
  <li>
    Moved reporting of skip messages to the Messages output in Test Explorer, so that it can be filtered by this
    in the Test Explorer UI. (Previously they had been reported as Output.)

  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>BUG:</strong> The <code>DisableAppDomain</code> run setting from VSTest was supported for
    execution but ignored for discovery. This has been fixed to be honored now for both, which should
    dramatically improve discovery performance for any .NET Framework project which has
    <a href="/docs/configuration-files#appDomain"><code>appDomain</code></a> set to <code>denied</code>.
    In simple testing with 10k tests on a machine with an AMD 5900X CPU and 64GB of RAM, this cut discovery
    time roughly in half, bringing it in line with the discovery time for .NET Core projects (which never
    support app domains).
