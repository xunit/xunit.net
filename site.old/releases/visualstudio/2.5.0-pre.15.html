<h1>Release Notes: May 31, 2023</h1>

<h2>
  xunit.runner.visualstudio 2.5.0 Pre-Release (build 15)
</h2>

<p>
  This is co-released with the core framework release
  <a href="/releases/v2/2.5.0-pre.22"><code>2.5.0-pre.22</code></a>.
</p>

<p class="note">
  This version has updated the minimum framework support to .NET Framework 4.6.2+ and .NET 6.0+.
  If you need support for older frameworks, please continue to use an older build of this project.<br />
  <br />
  This version also removes support for UWP projects. If you need continued support for UWP, please continue
  to use an older build of this project. UWP has been officially deprecated by Microsoft and we have similarly
  removed official support for UWP from the core framework and this adapter.
</p>

<h3>Features and Fixes</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    Added assembly-wide <code>ExcludeFromCodeCoverageAttribute</code> to all the xUnit.net assemblies.
    This should resolve issues with <code>dotnet test ---collect "Code Coverage"</code> (the new
    cross-platform code coverage system) incorrectly showing coverage for the adapter.
