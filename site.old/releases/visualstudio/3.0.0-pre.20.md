Today, we're shipping three new releases:

* xUnit.net Core Framework v3 `0.2.0-pre.69` ([release notes](/releases/v3/0.2.0-pre.69))
* xUnit.net Analyzers `1.16.0-pre.22` ([release notes](/releases/analyzers/1.16.0-pre.22))
* **xUnit.net Visual Studio adapter `3.0.0-pre.20`**

This is the first prerelease version of the Visual Studio runner which supports running v3 test projects. As always, it will continue to run v1 and v2 test projects. However, due to the minimum framework requirements for `xunit.v3.runner.utility`, the new minimum supported version of .NET Framework is 4.7.2, even for v1 and v2 test projects. The minimum supported version of .NET remains at 6.0.

As always, we'd like to thank all the users who contributed to the success of xUnit.net through usage, feedback, and code contributions. ðŸŽ‰

## Release Notes

These release notes are a list of changes from `2.8.1` to `3.0.0-pre.20`.

### Features and Fixes

* This is the first official prerelease of the Visual Studio adapter that's capable of running v3 test projects.

* We have started reporting `StartTime` and `EndTime` to VSTest, which should resolve rare cases where `dotnet test` could report incorrect total time for a test assembly.
