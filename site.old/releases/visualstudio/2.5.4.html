<p>Today, we're shipping three new releases:</p>

<p>It's been 5 weeks since the release of <a href="2.5.3">2.5.3 RTM</a>.</p>

  As always, we'd like to thank all the users who contributed to the success of xUnit.net through
  usage, feedback, and code. ðŸŽ‰

<h2>Release Notes</h2>

<p>These release notes are a comprehensive list of changes from 2.5.3 to 2.5.4.</p>

<h3>Features and Fixes</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    We have added a new <code>SilentReporter</code>, which can be selected with a <code>RunnerSwitch</code> value of
    <code>silent</code> via <a href="/docs/runsettings">RunSettings</a>. This reporter is designed to block all messages
    (other than the copyright banner/logo). This was requested for <code>xunit.runner.visualstudio</code> because of the
    habit of <code>dotnet test</code> to output some notices twice (once from our adapter, and once from VSTest). Note
    that this is not the default, so if you are among the users who are bothered by the double reporting in VSTest, this
    reporter is for you (and must be enabled via RunSettings).

  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>BUG:</strong> We were ignoring <a href="/docs/configuration-files#stopOnFail"><code>stopOnFail</code></a>
    when synchronous message reporting was requested. The most common trigger for this situation was disabling
    test collection parallelization while using <code>xunit.runner.visualstudio</code>. (This is actually a core
    framework bug whose fix is part of <a href="/releases/v2/2.6.2">2.6.2</a>.)
