Today, we're shipping one new release and two new prereleases:

* xUnit.net Core Framework v3 `0.3.0-pre.18` ([release notes](/releases/v3/0.3.0-pre.18))
* xUnit.net Analyzers `1.16.0` ([release notes](/releases/analyzers/1.16.0))
* **xUnit.net Visual Studio adapter `3.0.0-pre.30`**

It's been 4 weeks since the release of [`3.0.0-pre.24`](3.0.0-pre.24).

As always, we'd like to thank all the users who contributed to the success of xUnit.net through usage, feedback, and code contributions. ðŸŽ‰

## Release Notes

These release notes are a list of changes from `3.0.0-pre.24` to `3.0.0-pre.30`.

### Features and Fixes

* **BUG:** Fixed an issue where it was not possible to run v3 tests marked as Explicit. The logic now is:

  * If the whole project is run, do not run explicit tests.
  * If multiple tests are selected to run, only run explicit tests if every selected test is explicit.
  * If a single test is selected to run, always run it.

  This logic is necessary due to the fact that Test Explorer does not have a concept of 'explicit' tests. [xunit/visualstudio.xunit#412](https://github.com/xunit/visualstudio.xunit/issues/412){: .issue-link }

* **BUG:** In some situations, it was possible that `xunit.runner.json` was not being loaded (and default configuration values were used instead).
