<h1>Release Notes: October 12, 2023</h1>

<a href="https://www.dotnetfoundation.org/"><img align="right" src="/images/dotnet-fdn-logo.png" width="100" /></a>

<h2>Hello, 2.5.3!</h2>

<p>Today, we're shipping three new releases:</p>

<ul>
  <li>xUnit.net Core Framework v2 2.5.2 (<a href="/releases/v2/2.5.2">release notes</a>)</li>
  <li>xUnit.net Analyzers 1.4.0 (<a href="/releases/analyzers/1.4.0">release notes</a>)</li>
  <li><strong>xUnit.net Visual Studio adapter 2.5.3</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>It's been 1 month since the release of <a href="2.5.1">2.5.1 RTM</a>.</p>

<p>
  As always, we'd like to thank all the users who contributed to the success of xUnit.net through
  usage, feedback, and code contributions. ðŸŽ‰
</p>

<p><em>
  (In case you're wondering where 2.5.2 went...we discovered a bug while doing verification on the
  final builds, so we didn't ship 2.5.2. Instead, we fixed the bug and verified the fix, and then
  created the 2.5.3 release.)

<h2>Release Notes</h2>

<p>These release notes are a comprehensive list of changes from 2.5.1 to 2.5.3.</p>

<h3>Features and Fixes</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    The following types were moved here from <code>xunit.runner.utility</code>:
    <ul>
      <li><code>VisualStudioSourceInformationProvider</code></li>
      <li><code>DiaNavigationData</code></li>
      <li><code>DiaSession</code></li>
      <li><code>DiaSessionWrapper</code></li>
      <li><code>DiaSessionWrapperHelper</code></li>
    </ul>
    The runner now creates these types directly and passes them to <code>XunitFrontController</code>.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>BUG:</strong> The built-in reporters (including auto-reporters to support TeamCity, AppVeyor,
    and VSTS/Azure Pipelines) were broken in 2.5.1 with the <a href="https://github.com/xunit/visualstudio.xunit/issues/383">assembly merge</a>.
    <a class="issue-link" href="https://github.com/xunit/visualstudio.xunit/issues/384">xunit/visualstudio.xunit#384</a>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>BUG:</strong> The assembly merge that was part of the fix for
    <a href="https://github.com/xunit/visualstudio.xunit/issues/383">xunit/visualstudio.xunit#383</a>
    caused problems with third party runner reporters, and has been rolled back. The original issue in #383
    was determined to be unfixable on our end, and the suggested fix for developers who have version
    conflicts with <code>xunit.runner.utility</code> is to perform the IL merge that we were performing,
    except against their code rather than ours.

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>BUG:</strong> We fixed an issue with <code>dotnet test</code> on non-Windows platforms with .NET Framework,
      when AppDomains are enabled. This manifested with the following error:
    <p>
      <code>Catastrophic failure: System.TypeLoadException: Could not load type of field 'Xunit.Runner.VisualStudio.VsExecutionSink:recorder'
      (3) due to: Could not load file or assembly 'Microsoft.VisualStudio.TestPlatform.ObjectModel, Version=15.0.0.0, Culture=neutral,
      PublicKeyToken=b03f5f7f11d50a3a' or one of its dependencies.</code>
    </p>
    The fix was to add a dependency to <code>Microsoft.TestPlatform.ObjectModel</code> for .NET Framework projects. If
    you had previously done this by hand to work around this issue, you can now remove your added dependency.
