<h2>
  xunit.runner.visualstudio 2.5.2 Pre-Release (build 8)
</h2>

<p>
  This is co-released with core framework release v2
  <a href="/releases/v2/2.5.2-pre.6"><code>2.5.2-pre.6</code></a>.
</p>


<h3>Features and Fixes</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    The following types were moved here from <code>xunit.runner.utility</code>:
    <ul>
      <li><code>VisualStudioSourceInformationProvider</code></li>
      <li><code>DiaNavigationData</code></li>
      <li><code>DiaSession</code></li>
      <li><code>DiaSessionWrapper</code></li>
      <li><code>DiaSessionWrapperHelper</code></li>
    </ul>
    The runner now creates these types directly and passes them to <code>XunitFrontController</code>.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>BUG:</strong> The assembly merge that was part of the fix for
    <a href="https://github.com/xunit/visualstudio.xunit/issues/383">xunit/visualstudio.xunit#383</a>
    caused problems with third party runner reporters, and has been rolled back. The original issue in #383
    was determined to be unfixable on our end, and the suggested fix for developers who have version
    conflicts with <code>xunit.runner.utility</code> is to perform the IL merge that we were performing,
    except against their code rather than ours.
