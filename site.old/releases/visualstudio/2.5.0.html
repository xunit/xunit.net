<h1>Release Notes: July 6, 2023</h1>

<a href="https://www.dotnetfoundation.org/"><img align="right" src="/images/dotnet-fdn-logo.png" width="100" /></a>

<h2>Hello, 2.5.0!</h2>

<p>Today, we're shipping three new releases:</p>

<ul>
  <li>xUnit.net Core Framework v2 2.5.0 (<a href="/releases/v2/2.5.0">release notes</a>)</li>
  <li>xUnit.net Analyzers 1.2.0 (<a href="/releases/analyzers/1.2.0">release notes</a>)</li>
  <li><strong>xUnit.net Visual Studio adapter 2.5.0</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>
  It's been 14 months since the release of
  <a href="https://github.com/xunit/visualstudio.xunit/releases/tag/v2.4.5">2.4.5 RTM</a>.
</p>

<p class="note">
  This version has updated the minimum framework support to .NET Framework 4.6.2+ and .NET 6.0+, and
  has removed support for UWP. Users who require support for UWP or older version of .NET/.NET Core
  should continue to use an older build of this adapter.
</p>

<p>
  As always, we'd like to thank all the users who contributed to the success of xUnit.net through
  usage, feedback, and code contributions. ðŸŽ‰ And we would especially like to thank
  <a href="https://github.com/clairernovotny">Claire Novotny</a> who had been maintaining the
  Visual Studio adapter for several years.

<h2>Release Notes</h2>

<p>These release notes are a comprehensive list of changes from 2.4.5 to 2.5.0.</p>

<h3>Features and Fixes</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    Added assembly-wide <code>ExcludeFromCodeCoverageAttribute</code> to all the xUnit.net assemblies.
    This should resolve issues with <code>dotnet test ---collect "Code Coverage"</code> (the new
    cross-platform code coverage system) incorrectly showing coverage for the adapter.

  </li>
  <li>
    JSON configuration files can now use the new <a href="/docs/configuration-files#failSkips"><code>failSkips</code></a>
    configuration element to convert skipped tests into failed tests.
  </li>
  <li>
    Added support for <a href="/docs/configuration-files#stopOnFail"><code>stopOnFail</code></a> configuration file
    element.
  </li>
  <li>
    Moved reporting of skip messages to the Messages output in Test Explorer. This allows users to filter by skip
    reasons in the Test Explorer UI (since Messages is a searchable field). Previously, these had been reported
    in the Test Explorer UI as Output.

  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>BUG:</strong> The <code>DisableAppDomain</code> run setting from VSTest was supported for
    execution but ignored for discovery. This has been fixed to be honored now for both, which should
    dramatically improve discovery performance for any .NET Framework projects when VSTest has indicated
    that app domains are not required. In simple testing with 10k tests on a machine with an AMD 5900X CPU
    and 64GB of RAM, this cut discovery time roughly in half, bringing it in line with the discovery time
    for .NET Core projects (which have never supported app domains).

  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>BUG:</strong> Fixed a performance issue with reporter discovery related to scanning every single DLL
    in your output folder looking for types which implement reporters. <strong><em>Now we only scan libraries named</em></strong>
    <code>*reporters*.dll</code> <strong><em>which may break any custom reporters you are using from first or
    third party assemblies without an appropriate name.</em></strong>
    <a class="issue-link" href="https://github.com/xunit/visualstudio.xunit/issues/317">xunit/visualstudio.xunit#317</a>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>BUG:</strong> Fixed an issue where data-driven tests with only a params array could not
    be run with an empty `[InlineData]` declaration. For example, this worked:</p>
{% highlight csharp %}
[Theory]
[InlineData(new int[] { })]
public void MyTest(params int[] values)
{% endhighlight %}
    <p>But this would not:</p>
{% highlight csharp %}
[Theory]
[InlineData]
public void MyTest(params int[] values)
{% endhighlight %}
