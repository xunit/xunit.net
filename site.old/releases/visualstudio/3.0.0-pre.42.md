Today, we're shipping two new prereleases:

* xUnit.net Core Framework v3 `0.5.0-pre.27` ([release notes](/releases/v3/0.5.0-pre.27))
* **xUnit.net Visual Studio adapter `3.0.0-pre.42`**

It's been 4 weeks since the release of [`3.0.0-pre.35`](3.0.0-pre.35).

As always, we'd like to thank all the users who contributed to the success of xUnit.net through usage, feedback, and code contributions. ðŸŽ‰

### Features and Fixes
