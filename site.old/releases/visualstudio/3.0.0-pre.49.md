Today, we're shipping one new release and two new prereleases:

* xUnit.net Core Framework v3 `0.6.0-pre.7` ([release notes](/releases/v3/0.6.0-pre.7))
* xUnit.net Analyzers `1.17.0` ([release notes](/releases/analyzers/1.17.0))
* **xUnit.net Visual Studio adapter `3.0.0-pre.49`**

It's been 3 weeks since the release of [`3.0.0-pre.42`](3.0.0-pre.42).

As always, we'd like to thank all the users who contributed to the success of xUnit.net through usage, feedback, and code contributions. ðŸŽ‰

## Release Notes

These release notes are a list of changes from `3.0.0-pre.42` to `3.0.0-pre.49`.

### Features and Fixes

* We have added a new custom property to the VSTest Test Case object: `XunitSkipReason`. Note that this value is only filled in for tests which are unconditionally skipped; that is, if the test sets either `SkipWhen` or `SkipUnless` (indicating that it's conditionally skipped), then this value will not be present.
