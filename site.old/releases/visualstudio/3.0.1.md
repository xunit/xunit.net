Today, we're shipping three new releases:

* xUnit.net Core Framework v3 `1.0.1` ([release notes](/releases/v3/1.0.1))
* xUnit.net Analyzers `1.19.0`([release notes](/releases/analyzers/1.19.0))

## Release Notes

These release notes are a comprehensive list of changes from `3.0.0` to `3.0.1`.

### Features and Fixes

* **BUG:** We fixed an issue where the Visual Studio Code test navigation icons weren't showing up for unit tests. [xunit/visualstudio.xunit#433](https://github.com/xunit/visualstudio.xunit/issues/433){: .issue-link }

* **BUG:** We fixed an issue where some types from the CLR were being duplicated inside the runner DLL with public visibility. Those affected by this buf are limited to those who asked for all public types from all loaded assemblies and then came across one of the duplicated types. [xunit/visualstudio.xunit#431](https://github.com/xunit/visualstudio.xunit/issues/431){: .issue-link }
