<h3>Features and Fixes</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>BUG:</strong> To work around an occasional issue using <code>dotnet test</code> on non-Windows
      platforms with .NET Framework, we have updated the NuGet package to include a dependency for
      <a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.TestPlatform.ObjectModel">Microsoft.TestPlatform.ObjectModel</a>.
      Normally this should not be necessary, as this dependency should be provided by VSTest, but on occasion
      tests will fail to run with the following error:
    </p>
    <p>
      <code>Catastrophic failure: System.TypeLoadException: Could not load type of field 'Xunit.Runner.VisualStudio.VsExecutionSink:recorder'
      (3) due to: Could not load file or assembly 'Microsoft.VisualStudio.TestPlatform.ObjectModel, Version=15.0.0.0, Culture=neutral,
      PublicKeyToken=b03f5f7f11d50a3a' or one of its dependencies.</code>
    </p>
    <p>
      At this point in time, it's unclear what circumstances this happens under, but hopefully the dependency
      here should resolve the issue.
    </p>
    (The ideal fix would be to update <code>Microsoft.NET.Test.Sdk</code> to include <code>Microsoft.TestPlatform.ObjectModel</code>
    as a dependency, which it already does for .NET/.NET Core but does not for .NET Framework. Unfortunately, Microsoft
    has marked the linked issue below as "Won't Fix" despite evidence of several projects referencing it, having to fix
    the problem on their own. Even if they fix it, our change will help people who may end up still referencing an older
    version of <code>Microsoft.NET.Test.Sdk</code>, as it's not clear how often people will update this dependency in
    their projects.)
