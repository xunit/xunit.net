<h1>Release Notes: September 9, 2023</h1>

<h2>
  xunit.runner.visualstudio 2.5.1 Pre-Release (build 15)
</h2>

<p>
  This is co-released with core framework release v2
  <a href="/releases/v2/2.5.1-pre.33"><code>2.5.1-pre.33</code></a>.
</p>


<h3>Features and Fixes</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>BUG:</strong> Fixed an issue where file copies of <code>xunit.runner.utility.*.dll</code> and
    <code>xunit.runner.reporters.*.dll</code> could overwrite versions being used by runner authors, which
    would manifest as runtime issues like missing method exceptions. Fixing this required IL merging the
    output so those two DLLs don't exist on disk any more in the final <code>xunit.runner.visualstudio</code>
    NuGet package. Note that we still ship and copy <code>xunit.abstractions.dll</code> because that DLL has
    been frozen in time since we shipped v2 2.0 of the core framework (in 2015); any copy operations would
    result in the same file. We cannot IL merge this dependency, because it's needed on disk so that it has
    the same  identity in both the runner process and the <code>AppDomain</code> that's created to run .NET
    Framework tests.
