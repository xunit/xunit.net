<h2>Release Notes</h2>

<p>These release notes are a comprehensive list of changes from 2.5.6 to 2.5.7.</p>

<h3>Features and Fixes</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    We have fixed a package signing issue which was causing <code>xunit.abstractions.dll</code> to be re-signed
    despite already being signed, which then caused double-writes when the file was being copied during builds.
    This did not cause any runtime issues, as the binaries were still identical, but it did cause occasional
    unnecessary rebuilds (especially for .NET Framework projects) because of the competing files. (This was
    also true for <code>xunit.runner.reporters.*.dll</code> and <code>xunit.runner.utility.*.dll</code>, though
    that was less common as it would only affect writers of third party runners.)
