Today, we're shipping three new releases:

* xUnit.net Core Framework v2 2.8.1 ([release notes](/releases/v2/2.8.1))
* xUnit.net Analyzers 1.14.0 ([release notes](/releases/analyzers/1.14.0))
* **xUnit.net Visual Studio adapter 2.8.1**

It's been 1 month since the release of [2.8.0 RTM](2.8.0).

As always, we'd like to thank all the users who contributed to the success of xUnit.net through usage, feedback, and code contributions. ðŸŽ‰

## Release Notes

These release notes are a comprehensive list of changes from 2.8.0 to 2.8.1.

### Features and Fixes

* We have added the ability to show output from `ITestOutputHelper` immediately while a test is running rather than waiting for the test to complete. (Note: This can add significant noise to the output while running tests, so we recommend you only temporarily enable this when attempting to track down an issue with a misbehaving test that never finishes/takes a long time to finish.)

  * We have added a [`showLiveOutput`](/docs/configuration-files#showLiveOutput) configuration item
  * We have added a [`ShowLiveOutput`](/docs/runsettings#ShowLiveOutput) RunSettings item

  Note that `dotnet test` usually hides all output from xUnit.net unless you add the `--logger "console;verbosity=normal"` switch. To see output when running tests in Visual Studio Test Explorer, check the Output window's "Tests" tab. Screenshots are shown in the linked issue.
