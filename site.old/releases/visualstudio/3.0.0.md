Today, we're shipping three new releases:

* xUnit.net Core Framework v3 `1.0.0` ([release notes](/releases/v3/1.0.0))
* xUnit.net Analyzers `1.18.0` ([release notes](/releases/analyzers/1.18.0))

It's been 5 months since the release of [`2.8.2` RTM](2.8.2).

As always, we'd like to thank all the users who contributed to the success of xUnit.net through usage, feedback, and code contributions. ðŸŽ‰

## Release Notes

These release notes are a comprehensive list of changes from `2.8.2` to `3.0.0`.

### Features and Fixes

* This is the first official release of the Visual Studio adapter that's capable of running v3 test projects.

* We have started reporting `StartTime` and `EndTime` to VSTest, which should resolve rare cases where `dotnet test` could report incorrect total time for a test assembly. [xunit/visualstudio.xunit#401](https://github.com/xunit/visualstudio.xunit/issues/401){: .issue-link } [microsoft/vstest#4894](https://github.com/microsoft/vstest/issues/4894){: .issue-link }

* We have added four new [RunSettings options](/docs/runsettings): `Culture`, `Explicit`, `FailWarns`, and `Seed`.

* We have added a new custom property to the VSTest Test Case object: `XunitSkipReason`. Note that this value is only filled in for tests which are unconditionally skipped; that is, if the test sets either `SkipWhen` or `SkipUnless` (indicating that it's conditionally skipped), then this value will not be present. [xunit/visualstudio.xunit#422](https://github.com/xunit/visualstudio.xunit/issues/422){: .issue-link }

* **BUG:** We have fixed an issue where `xunit.runner.visualstudio` would not run tests on Linux or macOS when using Mono (for .NET Framework projects). This manifested as a warning message reading: `No test is available in /path/to/tests.exe. Make sure that test discoverer & executors are registered and platform & framework version settings are appropriate and try again.`  [xunit/visualstudio.xunit#411](https://github.com/xunit/visualstudio.xunit/issues/411){: .issue-link }

* **BUG:** Fixed an issue where it was not possible to run v3 tests marked as Explicit. The logic now is:

  * If the whole project is run, do not run explicit tests.
  * If multiple tests are selected to run, only run explicit tests if every selected test is explicit.
  * If a single test is selected to run, always run it.

  This logic is necessary due to the fact that Test Explorer does not have a concept of 'explicit' tests. [xunit/visualstudio.xunit#412](https://github.com/xunit/visualstudio.xunit/issues/412){: .issue-link }

* **BUG:** In some situations, it was possible that `xunit.runner.json` was not being loaded (and default configuration values were used instead).

* **BUG:** Fixed an issue launching the debugger in Visual Studio Code. [xunit/xunit#3019](https://github.com/xunit/xunit/discussions/3019){: .issue-link } [xunit/visualstudio.xunit#415](https://github.com/xunit/visualstudio.xunit/issues/415){: .issue-link }

* **BUG:** Fixed an issue where issuing a filter that matched no tests caused a catastrophic failure rather than simply running no tests. [xunit/visualstudio.xunit#417](https://github.com/xunit/visualstudio.xunit/issues/417){: .issue-link }

* **BUG:** We have fixed an issue where source information (file & line number) for a unit test was not reported when the test is inherited from a class in another project. [xunit/xunit#3023](https://github.com/xunit/xunit/issues/3023){: .issue-link }

* **BUG:** We have fixed an issue where command-line test runs could not filter based on traits coming from `ITheoryDataRow` due to not pre-enumerating theory data. [xunit/visualstudio.xunit#426](https://github.com/xunit/visualstudio.xunit/issues/426){: .issue-link }

* For developers contributing to `xunit.runner.visualstudio`, you can now build and run tests for the project on Linux and macOS.
