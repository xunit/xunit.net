<h1>Getting Started with xUnit.net</h1>
<h2>Using .NET Core with the .NET SDK command line</h2>

<p>
  In this article, we will demonstrate getting started with xUnit.net and .NET Core
  (including .NET 5), showing you how to write and run your first set of unit tests.
</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="#download-dotnet">Download the .NET SDK</a></li>
  <li><a href="#create-project">Create the unit test project</a></li>
  <li><a href="#write-first-tests">Write your first tests</a></li>

  <li><a href="#run-tests-visualstudio">Run tests with Visual Studio</a></li>
</ul>

<p><em>
  Note: The examples were done with xUnit.net v2 2.4.1, .NET SDK 5.0.102, and
  .NET 5.0. The version numbers, paths, and generated templates may differ for
  you, depending on which version you're using. Note that .NET Core 1.x-3.x and
  .NET 5.0+ are supported.
</em></p>

<h2 id="download-dotnet">Download the .NET SDK</h2>

<p>
  As of this writing, the .NET SDK is available for
  <a href="https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download">download</a> for Windows,
  Linux, and macOS. Once you've downloaded and installed the SDK, open a fresh
  command prompt of your choice (CMD, PowerShell, Bash, etc.) and make sure
  that you can access the CLI by typing <code>dotnet --version</code>. You
  should be rewarded with a single line, describing the version of the
  .NET Core SDK you have installed:
</p>

<pre>
$ dotnet --version
5.0.102
</pre>

<p><em>
  Note: the first time you run the <code>dotnet</code> command, it may
  perform some post-installation steps. Once these one-time actions are done,
  it will execute your command.
</em></p>

<h2 id="create-project">Create the unit test project</h2>

<p>
  From the command line, create a folder for your test project, change into it,
  and then create the project using <code>dotnet new</code>:
</p>

<pre>
$ mkdir MyFirstUnitTests
$ cd MyFirstUnitTests
$ dotnet new xunit
The template "xUnit Test Project" was created successfully.

Restore succeeded.
</pre>

<p>
  If you look at the generated <code>MyFirstUnitTests.csproj</code> project file,
  you should see content that looks something like this:
</p>

{% highlight xml %}
<Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk">

  <PropertyGroup>
    <TargetFramework>net5.0</TargetFramework>

    <IsPackable>false</IsPackable>
  </PropertyGroup>

  <ItemGroup>
    <PackageReference Include="Microsoft.NET.Test.Sdk" Version="16.7.1" />
    <PackageReference Include="xunit" Version="2.4.1" />
    <PackageReference Include="xunit.runner.visualstudio" Version="2.4.3">
      <IncludeAssets>runtime; build; native; contentfiles; analyzers; buildtransitive</IncludeAssets>
      <PrivateAssets>all</PrivateAssets>
    </PackageReference>
    <PackageReference Include="coverlet.collector" Version="1.3.0">
      <IncludeAssets>runtime; build; native; contentfiles; analyzers; buildtransitive</IncludeAssets>
      <PrivateAssets>all</PrivateAssets>
    </PackageReference>
  </ItemGroup>

</Project>
{% endhighlight %}

<p>Let's quickly review what's in this project file:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <code>TargetFramework</code> specifies the target framework for your test project. By default
    this will be the latest version of .NET Core that your system supports (in this example,
    .NET 5.0). Later in this article, we will discuss <a href="#multi-targeting">running tests
    against multiple target frameworks</a>.
  </li>
  <li>
    <code>IsPackable</code> is here, though it is redundant (unit test projects cannot be packed
    by default). You can safely remove this line if you wish.
  </li>
  <li>
    The <code>xunit</code> package brings in three child packages which include functionality
    that most developers want: <code>xunit.core</code> (the testing framework itself),
    <code>xunit.assert</code> (the library which contains the <code>Assert</code> class),
    and <code>xunit.analyzers</code> (which enables Roslyn analyzers to detect common issues
    with unit tests and xUnit.net extensibility).
  </li>
  <li>
    The packages <code>xunit.runner.visualstudio</code> and <code>Microsoft.NET.Test.Sdk</code>
    are required for being able to run your test project inside Visual Studio as well as with
    <code>dotnet test</code>.
  </li>
  <li>
    The <code>coverlet.collector</code> package allows collecting code coverage. If you don't
    intend to collect code coverage, you should remove this package reference.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>A single empty unit test was also generated into <code>UnitTest1.cs</code>:</p>

{% highlight C# %}
using System;
using Xunit;

namespace MyFirstUnitTests
{
    public class UnitTest1
    {
        [Fact]
        public void Test1()
        {

        }
    }
}
{% endhighlight %}

<p>Now let's verify that everything is working:</p>

<pre>
$ dotnet test

</pre>

<p>Excellent! Let's go replace that empty unit test with our first real tests.</p>

<h2 id="write-first-tests">Write your first tests</h2>

<p>
  Using your favorite text editor, open the <code>UnitTest1.cs</code> file and add a
  couple tests:
</p>

{% highlight C# %}
using Xunit;

namespace MyFirstUnitTests
{
    public class UnitTest1
    {
        [Fact]
        public void PassingTest()
        {
            Assert.Equal(4, Add(2, 2));
        }

        [Fact]
        public void FailingTest()
        {
            Assert.Equal(5, Add(2, 2));
        }

        int Add(int x, int y)
        {
            return x + y;
        }
    }
}
{% endhighlight %}

<p>Now let's go run the tests again and see what happens:</p>

</pre>

<p>
  Now that we've gotten your first unit tests to run, let's introduce one more
  way to write tests: using theories.
</p>

<h2 id="write-first-theory">Write your first theory</h2>

<p>
  You may have wondered why your first unit tests use an attribute named
  <code>[Fact]</code> rather than one with a more traditional name like Test.
  xUnit.net includes support for two different major types of unit tests:
  facts and theories. When describing the difference between facts and theories,
  we like to say:
</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Facts</strong> are tests which are always true. They test invariant conditions.</em></p>
  <p><em><strong>Theories</strong> are tests which are only true for a particular set of data.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>
  A good example of this is testing numeric algorithms. Let's say you want to
  test an algorithm which determines whether a number is odd or not. If you're
  writing the positive-side tests (odd numbers), then feeding even numbers
  into the test would cause it fail, and not because the test or algorithm
  is wrong.
</p>

<p>
  Let's add a theory to our existing facts (including a bit of bad data, so we
  can see it fail):
</p>

{% highlight C# %}
[Theory]
[InlineData(3)]
[InlineData(5)]
[InlineData(6)]
public void MyFirstTheory(int value)
{
    Assert.True(IsOdd(value));
}

bool IsOdd(int value)
{
    return value % 2 == 1;
}
{% endhighlight %}

<p>This time when we run our tests, we see a second failure, for our theory that was given 6:</p>

<pre>

Failed! - Failed: 2, Passed: 3, Skipped: 0, Total: 5, Duration: 4 ms< - MyFirstUnitTests.dll (net5.0)
</pre>

<p>
  Although we've only written 3 test methods, the test runner actually ran
  5 tests; that's because each theory with its data set is a separate test.
  Note also that the runner tells you exactly which set of data failed, because
  it includes the parameter values in the name of the test.
</p>

<h2 id="multi-targeting">Running tests against multiple target frameworks</h2>

<p>
  Sometimes, you want to write tests and ensure they run against several target
  application platforms. The xUnit.net test runner that we've been using supports
  .NET Core 1.0 or later, .NET 5.0 or later, and .NET Framework 4.5.2 or later.
  With a single test project, we can have our tests run against multiple target
  frameworks. Open the <code>.csproj</code> file and make the following change.
</p>

<p>Change <code>TargetFramework</code>:</strong></p>

{% highlight xml %}
<PropertyGroup>
  <TargetFramework>net5.0</TargetFramework>
</PropertyGroup>
{% endhighlight %}

<p>To <code>TargetFrameworks</code>:</p>

{% highlight xml %}
<PropertyGroup>
  <TargetFrameworks>net48;net5.0</TargetFrameworks>
</PropertyGroup>
{% endhighlight %}

<p>
  <code>dotnet test</code> supports any combination of .NET Core (including .NET 5+)
  and .NET Framework targets. You can even include multiple versions of the same
  target framework (for example, it's legal to have something like
  <code>&lt;TargetFrameworks&gt;net452;net461;net48;netcoreapp2.1;netcoreapp3.1;net5.0&lt;/TargetFrameworks&gt;</code>).
  Application authors will typically only use a single target framework, related to
  the target framework the application is intended to run on. Library authors are more
  likely to use several target frameworks, to ensure their tests run successfully on
  all supported target frameworks.
</p>

<p class="note">
  <code>dotnet test</code> with xUnit.net does not currently support .NET Framework on non-Windows
  environments (like Linux and macOS). You can run .NET Framework tests in these environments using
  <code>xunit.console.exe</code>, as discussed in <a href="/docs/getting-started/netfx/cmdline">Getting
  Started with xUnit.net Using .NET Framework with the command line</a>.<br />
  <br />
  <em><strong>Related content:</strong> <a href="/docs/why-no-netstandard">Why doesn't xUnit.net support netstandard?</a></em>
</p>

<p>
  Now when we run the tests, you can see that it runs both target frameworks, one after
  another:

<h2 id="run-tests-visualstudio">Running tests with Visual Studio</h2>

<p class="important">
  <strong>If you're having problems discovering or running tests,</strong> you may be a victim
  of a corrupted runner cache inside Visual Studio. To clear this cache, shut down all instances
  of Visual Studio, then delete the folder <code>%TEMP%\VisualStudioTestExplorerExtensions</code>.
  Also make sure your solution is only linked against a single version of the Visual Studio runner
  NuGet package (<code>xunit.runner.visualstudio</code>).
</p>

<p>
  If you have Visual Studio Community (or a paid-for version of Visual Studio), you can run your
  xUnit.net tests within Visual Studio's built-in test runner (named Test Explorer). Unfortunately,
  this does not include Express editions of Visual Studio (you should upgrade to the free
  <a href="https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/community/">Community Edition</a> instead).
</p>

<p>
  If your project doesn't have a solution file yet, you can use the <code>dotnet</code> command
  line to create one. Run the following two commands from your project folder:
</p>

<pre>
$ dotnet new sln
The template "Solution File" was created successfully.

$ dotnet sln add .
Project `MyFirstUnitTests.csproj` added to the solution.
</pre>

<p>
  Now open your solution with Visual Studio. (The screen shots and menu items here are
  taken from Visual Studio 2019; your version may be slightly different.)
</p>

<p>
  Make sure Test Explorer is visible (go to <code>Test &gt; Test Explorer</code>). Depending
  on the version of Visual Studio you have, you may need to build your test assembly before tests
  are discovered. After a moment of discovery, you should see the list of discovered tests:
</p>

<p><img class="border" src="/images/getting-started/common/test-explorer-theory-prerun-vs2019.png" width="390" /></p>

<p>
  Click the <code>Run All</code> link in the Test Explorer window, and you should see the results update
  in the Test Explorer window as the tests are run:
</p>

<p><img class="border" src="/images/getting-started/common/test-explorer-failure2-vs2019.png" width="888" /></p>

<p>
  You can click on a failed test to see the failure message, and the stack trace. You can click on the
  stack trace lines to take you directly to the failing line of code.
</p>
