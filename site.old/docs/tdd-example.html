<h1>Test-First Programming - By Example</h1>

<p>
  In this section I'll demonstrate how to implement a <i>Stack</i> using the
  test-first programming practice. The best way that I have seen to understand
  test-first is to see it practiced and follow along step-by-step. The following
  are the steps that I used to build a Stack.
</p>

<h2>The Task</h2>

<p>
  Let's imagine for a moment that you were just hired to work on a new class
  library. Your first task in the library will be to implement an <i>Unbounded Stack</i>.
  An <i>Unbounded Stack</i> is a data structure in which access is restricted
  to the most recently inserted item.
</p>

<blockquote>
  <b>Note</b>
  <p>
    An <i>Unbounded Stack</i> does not have to be pre-sized and you can insert
    an unlimited number of items into it.
  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>
  The operations include <i>Push</i>, <i>Pop</i>, <i>Peek</i>, <i>Contains</i>,
  and <i>Count</i>. The <i>Push</i> operation inserts an element onto the top
  of the <i>Stack</i> (Figure 1). The <i>Pop</i> operation removes the topmost
  element and returns it to the caller (Figure 2). The <i>Peek</i> operation
  returns the topmost element but does not remove it from the <i>Stack</i>
  (Figure 3). The <i>Contains</i> operation determines whether or not the items
  is on the <i>Stack</i>. Last but not least the <i>Count</i> operation returns
  the number of elements that are currently on the <i>Stack.</i>
</p>

<h2>Test List</h2>

<p>
  The first step is to brainstorm a list of tests for the task. The goal of
  this step is to create a candidate list of tests that describe the requirements
  and in turn define the completion requirements for the task. This list is fluid
  throughout the process of implementing each test. As you implement each test,
  you might have to revisit the list to <i>add</i> or <i>delete</i> tests. Here
  is a candidate test list for the <i>Unbounded Stack</i>:
</p>

<p>Tests:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="#step-1">Create a <i>Stack</i> and verify that <i>Count</i> returns zero.</a></li>
  <li><a href="#step-2">Create a <i>Stack</i>, <i>Push</i> a single element on the <i>Stack</i> and verify that <i>Count</i> is one.</a></li>
  <li><a href="#step-3">Create a <i>Stack</i>, <i>Push</i> N elements on the <i>Stack</i> and verify that <i>Count</i> is equal to N.</a></li>

  <li><a href="#step-6">Create a <i>Stack</i>, <i>Push</i> a single element remembering what it is, call <i>Pop</i> on the <i>Stack</i> and verify that the two objects are equal.</a></li>
  <li><a href="#step-7">Create a <i>Stack</i>, <i>Push</i> three elements remembering what they are, call <i>Pop</i> on the <i>Stack</i> repeatedly and verify that the elements are removed in the correct order, Last In First Out (LIFO).</a></li>     <li><a href="#step-8">Create a <i>Stack</i>, call <i>Pop</i> on the <i>Stack</i> and verify that an <i>InvalidOperationException</i> is thrown.</a></li>
  <li><a href="#step-9">Create a <i>Stack</i>, call <i>Peek</i> on the <i>Stack</i> and verify that an <i>InvalidOperationException</i> is thrown.</a></li>
  <li><a href="#step-10">Create a <i>Stack</i>, <i>Push</i> a single element remembering what it is, call <i>Peek</i> on the <i>Stack</i> and verify that the two objects are equal.</a></li>
  <li><a href="#step-11">Create a <i>Stack</i>,call <i>Contains</i> on the <i>Stack</i> and verify that it returns <i>false</i>.</a></li>
  <li><a href="#step-12">Create a <i>Stack</i>, <i>Push</i> three elements remembering what they are, call <i>Contains</i> with one of the elements and verify that it returns <i>true</i>.</a></li>
  <li><a href="#step-13">Create a <i>Stack</i> with a <i>parameterized</i> type, <i>Push</i> an element, call <i>Pop</i> and verify that it is equal to the element that was pushed.</a></li>
</ul>

<h2>Choosing the First Test</h2>

<p>
  There are differing opinions about which test to choose first. One opinion
  says that you should choose the simplest test that gets you started. Another
  says that you should choose a test that describes the essence of the problem
  you are trying to solve. For example, looking at the test list in the previous
  section, the simplest test is probably the first test: Create a <i>Stack</i>
  and verify the <i>Count</i> is zero. If you think about the implementation for
  a moment its dirt simple to implement. The downside is that the implementation
  does not provide a great deal of feedback for furthering the design and
  implementation of the <i>Stack</i>.
</p>

<p>
  If we were to pursue a test that describes the essence of the problem you
  could implement this test from the list: Create a <i>Stack</i>, <i>Push</i>
  three elements remembering what they are; <i>Pop</i> each one, and verify that
  they are removed in the correct Last In First Out Order (LIFO). A potential
  downside to choosing this approach is that it can take too much time to
  implement. If you believe it will take too long or require a number of
  decisions you should choose a simpler test to get started. The advice I give
  to people just starting out is to choose the simple test approach and gradually
  find a balance between too simple and too complex.
</p>

<p>
  For the purposes of this example I'll use the simplest test to implement first.
  The first test is "Create a <i>Stack</i> and verify the <i>Count</i> is zero."
</p>

<h2>Red/Green/Refactor</h2>

<p>Finally we can start writing some code.</p>

<h4 id="step-1">Test #1 - Create a Stack and verify that Count returns zero</h4>

<p>
  This test requires creating a <i>Stack</i> object and calling the <i>Count</i>
  property. The <i>Count</i> property should return zero because we have not
  inserted any elements into the <i>Stack</i>. Let's begin by creating a new
  file called "StackTests.cs". This class will contain all of the tests of the
  <i>Stack</i> class.
</p>

{% highlight C# %}
using Xunit;

public class StackTests
{
}
{% endhighlight %}

<p>
  The line <code>using Xunit;</code> is needed to reference the xUnit.net
  assembly. Unlike NUnit and similar frameworks xUnit.net does not need to have
  any class level attributes to indicate that the class contains tests.
</p>

<p>The next thing to do is write the test.</p>

{% highlight C# %}
using Xunit;

public class StackTests
{
    [Fact]
    public void EmptyStackCountMustBeZero()
    {
        Stack stack = new Stack();

        int count = stack.Count;

        Assert.Equal(0, count);
    }
}
{% endhighlight %}

<p>
  The method is marked with the <code>[Fact]</code> attribute. This is the
  indicator to the xUnit.net framework that this method is a fact and should be
  run. The name of the method is very important. It should be a statement of
  fact. In this case we are verifying that a <i>Stack</i> without elements
  should have a count of zero, hence "EmptyStackCountMustBeZero". Now, lets turn
  our attention to the test itself. The first thing that is done to is to create
  a <i>Stack</i> object. Once the object is created we then access the
  <code>Count</code> property and save the result into a local variable named
  <code>count</code>. Once we have the <code>count</code> result we verify that
  it is equal to zero using <code>Assert.Equal</code>. You could argue that the
  test is overly verbose because the last two statements could be combined into
  <code>Assert.Equal(0, stack.Count)</code>, which is true. However, the test
  as written conforms to the 3A pattern (Arrange, Act, Assert) which is the
  preferred style even though we have to create a temporary variable to separate
  the <i>Act</i> from the <i>Assert</i>.
</p>

<p>
  Although the class used in the test, <i>Stack</i> and the property
  <i>Count</i> do not exist, the code is written as if they do. When you are
  writing the test code you think about how the class and its methods are used
  instead of how they are implemented. This is one of the reasons that people
  refer to test-first as much a design technique as a testing technique. Many
  times, class library designers implement a library and then figure out how
  to use it, which can lead to libraries that require large amounts of
  initialization code, complex method interactions, and increased dependencies,
  in short - <b>hard to use</b>. Thinking about how to use the library prior to
  implementation places a larger emphasis on usage, which often leads to better
  design.
</p>

<p>
  If we were to try and compile the test code at this point you would find that
  does not compile. This is not surprising because it has been implemented as
  of yet. That should be relatively easy to fix. Before jumping in to write the
  code ask yourself the following question, "What is the smallest amount of work
  that needs to be done in order to get the code to compile?". Here is what I
  came up with:
</p>

{% highlight C# %}
public class Stack
{
    public int Count { get; private set; }
}
{% endhighlight %}

<p>
  The implementation is certainly minimalistic; in fact it might seem surprising.
  As I stated previously the goal is to do the smallest amount of work possible.
  The two questions you have to answer once you have written the test are,
  <em>Does the code compile?</em> and in turn, <em>Does the test pass?</em>
  In this case the answer to both of those questions is yes. This test is now
  complete and can be marked off the test list.
</p>

<p>
  Clearly there is a balance to achieve between anticipating future tests and
  implementation and being totally ignorant of the next test. In the beginning
  as you are learning you should focus on the test you are writing and its
  resulting implementation. As you become more familiar with the technique and
  the task, you can increase the granularity if the steps. However, if you should
  run into trouble the first thing I would recommend is to fall back to smaller
  steps to get back into a rhythm. One of the clear signals of thinking too far
  ahead with regards to implementation is when you write a test and it succeeds
  without changing the implementation.
</p>

<p>
  An example of thinking too far ahead on this step would be to think about the
  elements are going to be stored as part of this step. It is clear from the
  Test List that the Stack will have to store multiple elements. Is this the
  right time to implement that requirement? The answer is no. The current test
  does not require the <i>Stack</i> to store any elements. Let's defer that
  decision to later when the tests specify the requirement.
</p>

<p>
  Now that this test is complete which test should we choose next? I want to
  stay focused on the <code>Count</code> property because it is probably the
  smallest increment over what we have already implemented. Let's write Create
  a <i>Stack</i>, <i>Push</i> a single element on the <i>Stack</i> and verify
  that <i>Count</i> is one.
</p>

<h4 id="step-2">
  Test #2 - Create a <i>Stack</i>, <i>Push</i> a single element on the
  <i>Stack</i> and verify that <i>Count</i> is one.
</h4>

<p>Let's call this test <code>PushOneCountMustBeOne</code></p>

{% highlight C# %}
[Fact]
public void PushOneCountMustBeOne()
{
    Stack stack = new Stack();
    stack.Push(42);

    int count = stack.Count;

    Assert.Equal(1, count);
}
{% endhighlight %}

<p>
  The test creates a <i>Stack</i> object and then calls <i>Push</i> to insert an
  element onto the <i>Stack</i>. Once the object is created and the an element
  is Pushed onto the <i>Stack> </i>we then access the <code>Count</code>
  property and save the result into a local variable named <code>count</code>.
  Once we have the <code>count</code> result we verify that it is equal to one
  using <code>Assert.Equal</code>.
</p>

<p>
  If I was to try and compile this code it would fail because I have not
  implemented the <i>Push</i> method. Once again, what is the smallest amount
  of work needed to get the code to compile?
</p>

{% highlight C# %}
public void Push(int element) { }
{% endhighlight %}

<p>
  That is as small as possible. Now that it compiles we can then move forward
  and run the tests. Its important to note here that I said tests, run all of
  them not just the new one. Here are the results:
</p>

<pre>
------ Test started: Assembly: stack.dll ------

Test 'StackTests.PushOneCountMustBeOne' failed: Assert.Equal() Failure
Expected: 1
Actual:   0
    StackTests.cs(23,0): at StackTests.PushOneCountMustBeOne()

1 passed, 1 failed, 0 skipped, took 0.62 seconds.
</pre>

<p>
  The test failed because it was expecting the <i>Count</i> property of the
  <i>Stack</i> to return one and it returned zero. Since there is a failing
  test we can go forward and implement <i>Push</i> appropriately. The easiest
  thing to do is to just increment the <i>Count</i> property when <i>Push</i>
  is called. You might be jumping out of your seat right now saying that
  <i>Push</i> also needs to store the element that was pushed. I agree with
  that sentiment but the tests we have so far do not require the storage of
  the elements. Here's the updated <i>Push</i> method.
</p>

{% highlight C# %}
public void Push(int element)
{
    Count++;
}
{% endhighlight %}

<p>
  When I implement this the code compiles and when both tests are run they both
  pass. It's time to move onto the next test. I want to stay focused on the
  <i>Count</i> property so "Create a <i>Stack</i>, <i>Push</i> N elements on
  the <i>Stack</i> and verify that <i>Count</i> is equal to N" is next on the
  list.
</p>

<h4 id="step-3">
  Test #3 - Create a <i>Stack</i>, <i>Push</i> N elements on the <i>Stack</i>
  and verify that <i>Count</i> is equal to N.
</h4>

<p>We'll call this method PushNCountMustBeN</p>

{% highlight C# %}
[Fact]
public void PushNCountMustBeN()
{
    Stack stack = new Stack();
    stack.Push(42);
    stack.Push(21);
    stack.Push(12);

    int count = stack.Count;

    Assert.Equal(3, count);
}
{% endhighlight %}

<p>
  Interestingly enough when I compile and run this test it already passes with
  the existing implementation of <i>Stack</i>. You could ask yourself a few
  questions at this point. First , was I thinking about this test when I wrote
  the code in the previous test? Its possible but I don't see many other
  implementations of <i>Push></i> that would make both tests pass. Second,
  is this test redundant? I don't think it is but lets leave it in for now
  and decide later. Since the test passes there is nothing left to do but move
  onto the next test. Let's stay focused on the <i>Count</i> property and write
  "Create a <i>Stack</i>, <i>Push</i> a single element, call <i>Pop</i> on the
  <i>Stack</i> and verify that <i>Count</i> is zero.
</p>

<h4 id="step-4">
  Test #4 - Create a <i>Stack</i>, <i>Push</i> a single element, call <i>Pop</i>
  on the <i>Stack</i> and verify that <i>Count</i> is zero.
</h4>
