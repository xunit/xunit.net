title: Getting Started with xUnit.net v3
title-version: 2025 August 13
---

In this document, we will demonstrate getting started with xUnit.net v3 when targeting .NET 8 (or later) and/or .NET Framework 4.7.2 (or later), showing you how to write and run your first set of unit tests. We will be using the .NET SDK command line.

> [!NOTE]
> The examples were done with C#, xUnit.net v3 2.0.3, .NET SDK 9.0.301, and .NET 8. The version numbers, paths, and generated templates may differ for you, depending on the versions you're using. The instructions for .NET vs. .NET Framework are identical other than picking the appropriate target framework; however, being able to build and run .NET Framework tests on Linux or macOS requires installing [Mono](https://www.mono-project.com/download/stable/) first. See the [Multi-targeting with non-Windows OSes](/docs/getting-started/multi-target/non-windows) documentation for more information.

## Download the .NET SDK

The .NET SDK is available for [download](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) for Windows, Linux, and macOS.

Once you've downloaded and installed the SDK, open a fresh command prompt of your choice (CMD, PowerShell, bash, etc.) and make sure that you can access the command line by typing `dotnet --version`. You should be rewarded with a single line, describing the version of the .NET SDK you have installed:

```shell
$ dotnet --version
9.0.301
```

> [!NOTE]
> The first time you run the `dotnet` command, it may perform some post-installation steps. Once these one-time actions are done, it will execute your command.

## Install the .NET SDK templates

We ship templates for creating new projects, and they must be installed before they can be used.

From your command prompt, type: `dotnet new install xunit.v3.templates`

You should see the output similar to this:

```shell
$ dotnet new install xunit.v3.templates
The following template packages will be installed:
   xunit.v3.templates

Success: xunit.v3.templates::2.0.3 installed the following templates:
Template Name                   Short Name        Language    Tags
------------------------------  ----------------  ----------  ----------
xUnit.net v3 Extension Project  xunit3-extension  [C#],F#,VB  Test/xUnit
xUnit.net v3 Test Project       xunit3            [C#],F#,VB  Test/xUnit
```

As of this writing, we ship two templates (`xunit3` and `xunit3-extension`), in three languages (C#, F#, and VB.NET).

## Create the unit test project

From the command line, create a folder for your test project, change into it, and then create the project using `dotnet new`:

```shell
$ mkdir MyFirstUnitTests
$ cd MyFirstUnitTests
$ dotnet new xunit3
The template "xUnit.net v3 Test Project" was created successfully.

Processing post-creation actions...
Restoring .../MyFirstUnitTests/MyFirstUnitTests.csproj:
Restore succeeded.
```

The generated project file should look something like this:

```xml
<Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk">

  <PropertyGroup>
    <ImplicitUsings>enable</ImplicitUsings>
    <Nullable>enable</Nullable>
    <OutputType>Exe</OutputType>
    <RootNamespace>MyFirstUnitTests</RootNamespace>
    <TargetFramework>net8.0</TargetFramework>
    <!--
    To enable the Microsoft Testing Platform 'dotnet test' experience, add property:

    For more information on Microsoft Testing Platform support in xUnit.net, please visit:
      https://xunit.net/docs/getting-started/v3/microsoft-testing-platform
    -->
  </PropertyGroup>

  <ItemGroup>
    <Content Include="xunit.runner.json" CopyToOutputDirectory="PreserveNewest" />
  </ItemGroup>

  <ItemGroup>
    <Using Include="Xunit" />
  </ItemGroup>

  <ItemGroup>

    <PackageReference Include="xunit.runner.visualstudio" Version="3.1.1" />
  </ItemGroup>

</Project>
```

Let's quickly review what's in this project file:

* `ImplicitUsings` enables implicit `using` statements in your project. In addition to the default set of implicit `using` statements, you can see below that we've added an implicit `using` for the `Xunit` namespace where the most common xUnit.net types come from.
  _[More information about implicit usings](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/welcome-to-csharp-10/#global-and-implicit-usings)_{: .newline-indent }

* `Nullable` is enabled in this default template. Our libraries including nullable annotations to help you find when you may be accidentally dealing with `null` values. For example, `Assert.NotNull` is decorated in such a way that the compiler knows, if this assertion did not fail, then the value passed to it is known to not be `null`.
  _[More information about nullable reference types](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/csharp/nullable-references)_{: .newline-indent }

* `OutputType` is set to `Exe`, because unit test projects in xUnit.net v3 are stand-alone executables that can be directly run. We will see examples of this later in this document.
  _[More information about xUnit.net v3 and stand-alone executables](https://xunit.net/docs/getting-started/v3/migration#stand-alone-executables)_{: .newline-indent }

* `TargetFramework` is set to `net8.0` (which is the latest LTS build as of the writing of this document).
  _[More information about target frameworks](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/standard/frameworks)_{: .newline-indent }

* We have included an `xunit.runner.json` file in your project by default. You can edit this file and place configuration values into it.
  _[More information about xUnit.net configuration files](/docs/config-xunit-runner-json)_{: .newline-indent }

* We have included three package references:
  * `xunit.v3` is the core package needed to write unit tests for xUnit.net v3
  * `xunit.runner.visualstudio` and `Microsoft.NET.Test.Sdk` are used to enable support for VSTest-based runners, like `dotnet test` and Visual Studio Test Explorer

A single unit test was also generated (`UnitTest1.cs` in this example):

```csharp
namespace MyFirstUnitTests;

public class UnitTest1
{
    [Fact]
    public void Test1()
    {
        Assert.True(true);
    }
}
```

Now let's verify that everything is working by running our tests with `dotnet run`:

```shell
$ dotnet run
xUnit.net v3 In-Process Runner v2.0.3+216a74a292 (64-bit .NET 8.0.17)
  Discovering: MyFirstUnitTests
  Discovered:  MyFirstUnitTests
  Starting:    MyFirstUnitTests
  Finished:    MyFirstUnitTests
=== TEST EXECUTION SUMMARY ===
   MyFirstUnitTests  Total: 1, Errors: 0, Failed: 0, Skipped: 0, Not Run: 0, Time: 0.059s
```

> [!NOTE]
> You can pass command line options to the test runner when using `dotnet run`, but you must add `--` before passing any command line options. The reason for this is that the .NET SDK differentiates command line options **before** the `--` as command line options for `dotnet run` itself vs. command line options **after** the `--` as command line options for the program.
>
> Try running `dotnet run -?` and `dotnet run -- -?` to see the difference.

Excellent! Let's go replace that sample unit test with our first real tests.

## Write your first tests

Using your favorite text editor, open the `UnitTest1.cs` file and replace the existing test with two new ones:

```csharp
namespace MyFirstUnitTests;

public class UnitTest1
{
    [Fact]
    public void PassingTest()
    {
        Assert.Equal(4, Add(2, 2));
    }

    [Fact]
    public void FailingTest()
    {
        Assert.Equal(5, Add(2, 2));
    }

    int Add(int x, int y)
    {
        return x + y;
    }
}
```

If we run the tests again, we should see something like this:

```shell
$ dotnet run
xUnit.net v3 In-Process Runner v2.0.3+216a74a292 (64-bit .NET 8.0.17)
  Discovering: MyFirstUnitTests
  Discovered:  MyFirstUnitTests
  Starting:    MyFirstUnitTests
    MyFirstUnitTests.UnitTest1.FailingTest [FAIL]
      Assert.Equal() Failure: Values differ
      Expected: 5
      Actual:   4
      Stack Trace:
        UnitTest1.cs(14,0): at MyFirstUnitTests.UnitTest1.FailingTest()
  Finished:    MyFirstUnitTests
=== TEST EXECUTION SUMMARY ===
   MyFirstUnitTests  Total: 2, Errors: 0, Failed: 1, Skipped: 0, Not Run: 0, Time: 0.097s
```

We can see that we have one passing test, and one failing test. That's exactly what we would expect given what we wrote.

Now that we're gotten our first tests to run, let's introduce one more way to write tests: using theories.

## Write your first theory

You may have wondered why your first unit tests use an attribute named <code>[Fact]</code> rather than one with a more traditional name like Test. xUnit.net includes support for two different major types of unit tests: facts and theories. When describing the difference between facts and theories, we like to say:

> _**Facts** are tests which are always true. They test invariant conditions._
>
> _**Theories** are tests which are only true for a particular set of data._

A good example of this is testing numeric algorithms. Let's say you want to test an algorithm which determines whether a number is odd or not. If you're writing the positive-side tests (odd numbers), then feeding even numbers into the test would cause it fail, and not because the test or algorithm is wrong.

Let's add a theory to our existing facts (including a bit of bad data, so we can see it fail):

```csharp
[Theory]
[InlineData(3)]
[InlineData(5)]
[InlineData(6)]
public void MyFirstTheory(int value)
{
    Assert.True(IsOdd(value));
}

bool IsOdd(int value)
{
    return value % 2 == 1;
}
```

This time when we run our tests, we see a second failure, for our theory that was given 6:

```shell
$ dotnet run
xUnit.net v3 In-Process Runner v2.0.3+216a74a292 (64-bit .NET 8.0.17)
  Discovering: MyFirstUnitTests
  Discovered:  MyFirstUnitTests
  Starting:    MyFirstUnitTests
    MyFirstUnitTests.UnitTest1.FailingTest [FAIL]
      Assert.Equal() Failure: Values differ
      Expected: 5
      Actual:   4
      Stack Trace:
        UnitTest1.cs(14,0): at MyFirstUnitTests.UnitTest1.FailingTest()
    MyFirstUnitTests.UnitTest1.MyFirstTheory(value: 6) [FAIL]
      Assert.True() Failure
      Expected: True
      Actual:   False
      Stack Trace:
        UnitTest1.cs(28,0): at MyFirstUnitTests.UnitTest1.MyFirstTheory(Int32 value)
  Finished:    MyFirstUnitTests
=== TEST EXECUTION SUMMARY ===
   MyFirstUnitTests  Total: 5, Errors: 0, Failed: 2, Skipped: 0, Not Run: 0, Time: 0.085s
```

Although we've only written 3 test methods, the test runner actually ran 5 tests; that's because each theory with its data set is a separate test. Note also that the runner tells you exactly which set of data failed, because it includes the parameter values in the name of the test.

## Using Visual Studio

> [!NOTE]
> These screen shots were taken with Visual Studio 2022 version 17.14.5. Your screen may look slightly different if you have a newer version. The latest version of Visual Studio 2022 also supports Microsoft Testing Platform (which is natively implemented in xUnit.net v3), so the instructions to add the `xunit.runner.visualstudio` and `Microsoft.NET.Test.Sdk` packages may not be necessary.

Visual Studio contains a test runner called Test Explorer that can run unit tests from a variety of third party test frameworks, including xUnit.net. The inclusion of `xunit.runner.visualstudio` (and `Microsoft.NET.Test.Sdk`) allows Test Explorer to find and run our tests.

Visual Studio works on _solutions_ rather than _projects_. If your project doesn't have a solution file yet, you can use the .NET SDK to create one. Run the following two commands from your project folder:

```shell
$ dotnet new sln
The template "Solution File" was created successfully.

$ dotnet sln add .
Project `MyFirstUnitTests.csproj` added to the solution.
```

Now open your solution with Visual Studio. Build your solution after it has opened. Make sure Test Explorer is visible (go to `Test > Test Explorer`).

### Via Test Explorer

After a moment of discovery, you should see the list of discovered tests:

![Visual Studio Test Explorer](/images/getting-started/v3/visualstudio-testexplorer-icons.png){: .border width=461 }

By default, the test list is arranged by project, namespace, class, and finally test method. In this case, the `MyFirstTheory` method shows 3 sub-items, as that is a data theory with 3 data rows.

Clicking the run button (the double play button) in the Test Explorer tool bar will run your tests:

![Visual Studio Test Explorer (after tests have run)](/images/getting-started/v3/visualstudio-testexplorer-run.png){: .border width=431 }

You can double click on any test in the list to be taken directly to the source code for the test in question.

### Via source code

You should notice after the build is complete that your unit test source becomes decorated with small blue `i` icons that indicate that there is a runnable test:

![Visual Studio unit test source](/images/getting-started/v3/visualstudio-source-icons.png){: .border width=278 }

Clicking the `i` will pop up a panel that will allow you to Run or Debug your tests, as well as navigate to the test inside Test Explorer. After running the tests, you'll see that the icons now change to indicate which tests are currently passing vs. failing:

![Visual Studio unit test source (after tests have run)](/images/getting-started/v3/visualstudio-source-run.png){: .border width=279 }

## Using Visual Studio Code

> [!NOTE]
> These screen shots were taken with Visual Studio Code version 1.101.2 and C# Dev Kit extension version 1.30.32. Your screen may look slightly different if you have newer versions. The latest version of C# Dev Kit also supports Microsoft Testing Platform (which is natively implemented in xUnit.net v3), so the instructions to add the `xunit.runner.visualstudio` and `Microsoft.NET.Test.Sdk` packages may not be necessary. You may need to enable MTP support by setting `"dotnet.testWindow.useTestingPlatformProtocol": true` in your VS Code configuration file.

To be able to build C# test projects and run their tests, install the [C# Dev Kit](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-dotnettools.csdevkit) extension into Visual Studio Code. The inclusion of `xunit.runner.visualstudio` (and `Microsoft.NET.Test.Sdk`) allows the Visual Studio Code testing panel (and the C# extension) to find and run our tests.

From the command prompt, open Visual Studio code on your project folder by running: `code .`

Using the side bar on the left, click the Explorer side bar (it's probably already selected by default), and make sure Solution Explorer is visible. You should see something like this:

![Visual Studio Code Solution Explorer](/images/getting-started/v3/vscode-solution-explorer.png){: .border width=184 }

To build your project, right click on "MyFirstUnitTests" and choose "Build".

### Via Testing side bar

Once the project has finished building, click on the Testing panel. After a moment of discovery, you should see the list of discovered tests:

![Visual Studio Code Testing Panel](/images/getting-started/v3/vscode-testing-panel.png){: .border width=414 }

By default, the test list is arranged by project, namespace, class, and finally test method. In this case, the `MyFirstTheory` method shows 3 sub-items, as that is a data theory with 3 data rows.

Clicking the run button (the double play button) in the Testing panel tool bar will run your tests:

![Visual Studio Code Testing Panel (after tests have run)](/images/getting-started/v3/vscode-testing-run.png){: .border width=362 }

You can double click on any test in the list to be taken directly to the source code for the test in question.

### Via source code

Once the project has finished building, you should notice that your unit test source becomes decorated with play icons that you can click to run your tests:

![Visual Studio Code unit test source](/images/getting-started/v3/vscode-source-icons.png){: .border width=350 }

After running the tests, you'll see that the icons now change to indicate which tests are currently passing vs. failing, and failed tests will include failure information inline with your source code:

![Visual Studio Code unit test source (after tests have run)](/images/getting-started/v3/vscode-source-run.png){: .border width=522 }

## Using JetBrains Rider

> [!NOTE]
> These screen shots were taken with Rider 2024.2. Your screen may look slightly different if you have a newer version. The latest version of Rider also supports Microsoft Testing Platform (which is natively implemented in xUnit.net v3), so the instructions to add the `xunit.runner.visualstudio` and `Microsoft.NET.Test.Sdk` packages may not be necessary.

Rider contains a Tests tool window that can run tests from a variety of third party test frameworks, including xUnit.net. The inclusion of `xunit.runner.visualstudio` (and `Microsoft.NET.Test.Sdk`) allows the Tests tool window to find and run our tests.

Open your project in Rider. Build the project by right clicking on it and choosing "Build Selected Projects".

### Via Tests tool window

Once the project has finished building, click on the Tests tool window. After a moment of discovery, you should see the list of discovered tests:

![JetBrains Rider Tests tool window](/images/getting-started/v3/rider-tests-icons.png){: .border }

By default, the test list is arranged by project, namespace, class, and finally test method.

Clicking the run button (the double play button) in the Tests tool window will run your tests:

![JetBrains Rider Tests tool window (after tests have run)](/images/getting-started/v3/rider-tests-run.png){: .border }

You can double click on any test in the list to be taken directly to the source code for the test in question.

### Via source code

Once the project has finished building, you should notice that your unit test source becomes decorated with play icons that you can click to run your tests:

![JetBrains Rider unit test source](/images/getting-started/v3/rider-source-icons.png){: .border }

After running the tests, you'll see that the icons now change to indicate which tests are currently passing vs. failing:

![JetBrains Rider unit test source (after tests have run)](/images/getting-started/v3/rider-source-run.png){: .border }

## Using `dotnet test`

In addition to directly running your test project, the inclusion of `xunit.runner.visualstudio` (and `Microsoft.NET.Test.Sdk`) means that you can also use the test runner build into the .NET SDK. It has different command line options (compare `dotnet run -- -?` with `dotnet test -?`).

The output from this runner will look different than the built-in runner:

```

```

## Using `xunit.v3.runner.console`

If you've used previous versions of xUnit.net, you may have used our first party runner: `xunit.console`.

For v3, we now ship that console runner as `xunit.v3.runner.console`. Like previous versions, we ship it for multiple builds of .NET Framework as well as AnyCPU vs. x86 versions.

Given that a v3 test project can run itself, do you need to use `xunit.v3.runner.console`? The short answer is: not if you running a single v3 test project. The longer answer is: you might, if you want to run multiple test projects in parallel, and/or you want to include xUnit.net v1 or v2 projects in addition to v3 projects.

Using the v3 console runner is much like the v2 console runner: you pass it a list of test assemblies, and an optional list of command line options that influence the execution. In its simplest form, you can run it just like this:

```
$ /path/to/xunit.v3.runner.console.exe /path/to/test-assembly-1.dll /path/to/test-assembly-2.exe
```

For a complete list of command line options, invoke `xunit.v3.runner.console` with no arguments. Here is an abbreviated example of that output:

```
$ ~\.nuget\packages\xunit.v3.runner.console\2.0.3\tools\net472\xunit.v3.runner.console.exe
xUnit.net v3 Console Runner v2.0.3+216a74a292 [net472/AnyCPU] (64-bit .NET Framework 4.8.9300.0)
Copyright (C) .NET Foundation.

usage: xunit.v3.runner.console <assemblyFile>[:seed] [configFile] [assemblyFile[:seed] [configFile]...] [options] [reporter] [resultFormat filename [...]]

Note: Configuration files must end in .json (for JSON) or .config (for XML)
      XML is supported for v1 and v2 only, on .NET Framework only
      JSON is supported for v2 and later, on all supported platforms

General options

  -assertEquivalentMaxDepth <option> : override the maximum recursive depth when comparing objects with Assert.Equivalent
                                     :   any integer value >= 1 is valid (default value is 50)
  -culture <option>                  : run tests under the given culture (v3 assemblies only)
                                     : note: when running a v1/v2 assembly, the culture option will be ignored
                                     :   default   - run with default operating system culture
                                     :   invariant - run with the invariant culture
                                     :   (string)  - run with the given culture (i.e., 'en-US')
[...]
```

A few notable things about running with `xunit.v3.runner.console`:

* The new v3 `xunit.v3.runner.console` can run both .NET Framework and .NET tests projects (although it can only run v3 versions of .NET projects). The v2 version of `xunit.console` can only run .NET Framework projects.

* When running v3 test projects, they are run in a separate process. Like previous versions of `xunit.console`, it continues to run v1 and v2 test projects in the same process as the console runner (optionally in a separate AppDomain, if needed). Running them in a separate process does incur some overhead vs. running them directly, though in practice this should be fairly benign for most users.

* Result files from `xunit.v3.runner.console` contain run information for all tests assemblies in a single report. If you were run each v3 project individually and ask for a result file, it would only include information for that single test assembly.

* Custom reporters are not available through `xunit.v3.runner.console`, as they are installed into the v3 test assembly's runner directly. If you are using a custom reporter, then you must directly run the test project.

### Using a response file with `xunit.v3.runner.console`{: #response-file }

In the rare case that your command line exceeds the 32K character limit in Windows, you can use a "response file" to provide the command line arguments rather than the command line.

In "response file mode", the command line must contain only `@@ filename`, and the filename that's pointed must contain one command line argument per line (no quoting). For example, if you have this command line:

```
/path/to/MyTestProject.exe -culture en-GB -noLogo -maxThreads 32 -xml "/path/to/The XML Output File.xml"
```

You would create a response file (we'll call `/path/to/response-file`) with this content:

```text
-culture
en-GB
-noLogo
-maxThreads
32
-xml
/path/to/The XML Output File.xml
```

And run the tests with this command line:

```
/path/to/MyTestProject.exe @@ /path/to/response-file
```
