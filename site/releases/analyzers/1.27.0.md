## Release Notes

These release notes are a comprehensive list of changes from `1.26.0` to `1.27.0`.

### Usage Analyzers

* **BUG:** Fixed an issue with [xUnit1019](/xunit.analyzers/rules/xUnit1019) where the analyzer would improperly flag some return types that are compatible. For example, `IEnumerable<string[]>` is type-compatible with `IEnumerable<object[]>` but would be flagged. [xunit/xunit#3411](https://github.com/xunit/xunit/issues/3411){: .issue-link }
