Today, we're shipping two new releases:

* xUnit.net Core Framework v3 `3.2.0` ([release notes](/releases/v3/3.2.0))
* **xUnit.net Analyzers `1.25.0`**

It's been 3½ months since the release of [`1.24.0`](/releases/analyzers/1.24.0).

As always, we'd like to thank all the users who contributed to the success of xUnit.net through usage, feedback, and code. 🎉

## Release Notes

These release notes are a comprehensive list of changes from `1.24.0` to `1.25.0`.

### Usage Analyzers

* We have added [xUnit1053](/xunit.analyzers/rules/xUnit1053) to point out when reference `[MemberData]` has not been initialized. Failing to initialize the member data appropriate results in zero data rows during discovery/execution. [xunit/xunit#1258](https://github.com/xunit/xunit/issues/1258){: .issue-link }

### Extensibility Analyzers

* We have updated [xUnit3001](/xunit.analyzers/rules/xUnit2002) to not trigger when the class in question is abstract. Public parameterless constructors are only required for instantiable classes covered by xUnit3001. [xunit/xunit#3169](https://github.com/xunit/xunit/issues/3169){: .issue-link }
