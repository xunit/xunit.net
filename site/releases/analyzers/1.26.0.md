It's been 4 weeks since the release of [`1.25.0`](/releases/analyzers/1.25.0).

As always, we'd like to thank all the users who contributed to the success of xUnit.net through usage, feedback, and code. 🎉

## Release Notes

These release notes are a comprehensive list of changes from `1.25.0` to `1.26.0`.

### Usage Analyzers

* **BUG:** We have fixed an issue in [xUnit1051](/xunit.analyzers/rules/xUnit1051) where the analyzer did not take into account `[Obsolete]` attributes when determining if the user should call overloads with a `CancellationToken` parameter. [xunit/xunit#3439](https://github.com/xunit/xunit/issues/3439){: .issue-link }

### Assertion Analyzers

* **BUG:** We have fixed an issue in the fixer for [xUnit2022](/xunit.analyzers/rules/xUnit2022) where the user message argument was not being preserved when the assertion was flipped from `True` to `False` (or vice versa). [xunit/xunit.analyzers#198](https://github.com/xunit/xunit.analyzers/pull/198){: .issue-link }
