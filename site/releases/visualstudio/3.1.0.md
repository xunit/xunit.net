Today, we're shipping two new releases:

* xUnit.net Core Framework v3 `2.0.2` ([release notes](/releases/v3/2.0.2))
* **xUnit.net Visual Studio adapter `3.1.0`**

It's been 3 months since the release of [`3.0.2`](/releases/visualstudio/3.0.2).

As always, we'd like to thank all the users who contributed to the success of xUnit.net through usage, feedback, and code. 🎉

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This version is updated to use the a 2.x version of `xunit.v3.runner.utility`, which has a new minimum target version of .NET 8. This means that running test projects that target .NET 6/7 is no longer supported (and may not work). If you're stuck on one of these out-of-date versions of .NET, you may need to stick with the `3.0.2` release.

## Release Notes

These release notes are a comprehensive list of changes from `3.0.2` to `3.1.0`.

* **BUG:** Fixed an issue where a race condition with a shutting down AppDomain could cause an error message to be emitted for v1 and v2 test projects.

* **BUG:** Fixed an issue where duplicate test case ID warnings for v3 projects due to Test Explorer passing duplicate tests for projects which are multi-targeted.
